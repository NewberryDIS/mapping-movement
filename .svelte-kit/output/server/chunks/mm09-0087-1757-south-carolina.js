A conversion to Protestantism forced him out of that role and onto a boat bound for Georgia. The governors of Georgia and South Carolina quickly realized the advantage of having a professionally trained engineer and surveyor, each appointing De Brahm as Surveyor General for their respective colonies. In this position, De Brahm had access to each colonyâ€™s survey records and used them, along with his own surveys and observations, to compile this map, published in London in 1757. It remained the standard coastal chart of South Carolina and Georgia for decades.</p>`;
