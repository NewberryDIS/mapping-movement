<p>The original of Hunter’s untitled manuscript map is housed with the Library of Congress, cataloged under the title “This represents the Charecke Nation by Col. Herberts Map…” The Newberry houses a published version of the map, traced from the original document. The reproduction itself is a fascinating object, but it should be noted that the original contained two separate sets of annotations, one from Hunter and one from Governor James Glen. The reprint version makes it difficult to see which man wrote what.</p>`;
