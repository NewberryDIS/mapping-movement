Despite its authorship, the map was printed in London in 1775. The map thus obscures authorship but does make sure its readers know that, for example, the map of Boston harbor in the upper right was from “an actual survey.” The map features some impressive artwork, particularly in the dramatic scene of British ships bombarding Charlestown.</p>`;
