A pamphlet published in 1879 by this Chicago printing firm specializing in on railroad work, explained how railroad officials realized the importance of map design in structuring a map to achieve their purposes. An experienced draughtsman played a key role in railroad cartography because “the ‘designing’ of a good map involves the exercise of tact and ingenuity” in addition to the considerable skills that went into the drawing of any map. “The majority of railroad maps have some ‘peculiar design’ hidden under the careful pencil of the draughtsman.…The various friendly interests must be shown to best advantage, and the rival interests disposed of in a manner that ‘no fellow can find out’” (quoted in Modelski, "),Ka=i("em"),yi=o("Railroad Maps of North America,"),gi=o(" xix; see Maps "),Le=i("a"),vi=o("5"),wi=o(", "),Be=i("a"),bi=o("9"),Ei=o(", and "),Ge=i("a"),Mi=o("10"),ki=o(").

An experienced draughtsman played a key role in railroad cartography because “the ‘designing’ of a good map involves the exercise of tact and ingenuity” in addition to the considerable skills that went into the drawing of any map. “The majority of railroad maps have some ‘peculiar design’ hidden under the careful pencil of the draughtsman.…The various friendly interests must be shown to best advantage, and the rival interests disposed of in a manner that ‘no fellow can find out’” (quoted in Modelski, "),Ka=n(R,"EM",{});var uh=s(Ka);yi=r(uh,"Railroad Maps of North America,"),uh.forEach(t),gi=r(R," xix; see Maps "),Le=n(R,"A",{href:!0});var yh=s(Le);vi=r(yh,"5"),yh.forEach(t),wi=r(R,", "),Be=n(R,"A",{href:!0});var gh=s(Be);bi=r(gh,"9"),gh.forEach(t),Ei=r(R,", and "),Ge=n(R,"A",{href:!0});var vh=s(Ge);Mi=r(vh,"10"),vh.forEach(t),ki=r(R,").
