Earlier views of cartographic history have marked this century as the era when science began its triumph over art in the production of maps in a perfect symbol for the larger Age of Reason and Enlightenment. The fanciful decorations of early modern maps seemingly vanished as mapmakers increasingly became “cartographers,” that is, devotees of the idea that a map’s value and beauty lay in its “objective” depiction of physical and human geography in as scientifically “accurate” a manner as possible, or according to the “Newest and most exact Observations,” as one mapmaker put it (Herman Moll, below). More recently, as scholars of the Enlightenment period have come to identify not a single “Age of Reason” descending like a curtain across the minds of Europeans, they have likewise come to revise their view of Enlightenment maps. Maps still can be seen as exemplars of Enlightenment, but the Enlightenment is not what it used to be. Recent studies have begun to emphasize multiple Enlightenments, loosely held together by new ideals of truth that crossed national (and sometimes cultural, racial, and gendered) borders but that were always everywhere conditioned by local and regional systems of belief.

In this new idea of Enlightenments, the seemingly blank and plain maps of the 1700s come alive with new meanings. In this new light, the maps reemerge as places of contest and struggle. Across their seemingly plain surfaces, one can trace contests of authority and definition, of legitimation and denial. Indeed, plainness itself was a conscious rhetorical move in service of ideological and political aims rather than a self-evident necessity. (Edney 1999, 169) In their multiple and not even internally consistent approaches to the idea of geographic “truth,” these Enlightenment maps represent a distinct phase within the larger history of Euro-American mapmaking quite apart from the earlier so-called “artistic” maps of the early modern period and the later, professionalized “scientific” cartography of the 1800s.

While the distance between ideal and reality was always great in mapmaking, the American gap was perhaps larger than most. Even in Europe, Europeans struggled with the ongoing delays between the development of new ideals of “truth” in mapmaking and the techniques of measuring the earth required to reach those ideals. But in Europe and elsewhere, these mapmakers managed to find new forms of data gathering better suited to the emerging politics of the idealized Enlightenment map, supplementing traditional narrative accounts of travel and exploration with the techniques of triangulation on land and astronomical observation at sea and combined these with the constant corroboration of written sources. (Edney, 1999) They did this in France, in Russia, in China, and in the Pacific bringing a new idea of mapmaking to the problems of mapping the world (Mapp, 2011, 166-201)."),Le=i(),L=r("p"),Vt=s("In North America, however, these new techniques were not easily applied, leaving these new ideals of mapmaking to rely on the same old narratives of travelers that they had for centuries. In a continent where trained surveyors were few and far between, it is unsurprising that, aside from coastal surveys, mapmakers relied heavily on the traditional sources of geographic information—travel accounts from the various inhabitants of the continent. The tension between mapmakers’ ambitions and the reality of mapping in British North America is what makes eighteenth-century American maps so interesting. Numerous voices and conceptions of geography competed for representation on printed maps. Each mapmaker had to reconcile the personalized, subjective movement-based origins of their information with the Enlightenment mandate to present a more universalized, depersonalized and therefore supposedly “accurate” map of the continent. Each mapmaker and their cadre of artists of engravers had to privilege certain kinds of information and discard others without any defined guidelines. Every map of North America in the eighteenth century was therefore an experiment and an improvisation. The eighteenth century was not a simple journey from crude to refined. It was instead an era in which new conceptions of what a map should be interacted and conflicted with the realities of what a map could be.

One is the persistence of human movement within the features of the map. Despite map printers’ desire to market their maps as impersonal, universal, and “accurate,” the very real human motions that generated the mapmakers’ main archive of information still presented themselves throughout the era. Likely in response, mapmakers developed strategies to deflect the readers’ attention away from this aspect of the map’s creation, in particular encouraging readers to quickly move past the facts of the map’s creation and to instead indulge in the visual pleasures of imagining travel through North America. This coaching by mapmakers in turn helped spur the map-reading public to use their imaginations to envision movements bigger than those of individual travelers and to see whole processes of history unfolding across their lines. In other words, through various rhetorical and design strategies, eighteenth-century mapmakers helped train their audiences to see maps not as the result of past travels, but as tools of the reader’s vision to encourage future movements, both imagined and real.

In an age of early settlement and colonization, the individual journey was often the fastest path to new geographic information. European mapmakers relied on singular journeys for their maps, and atlases of the Americas and did very little to disguise the nature of their sources. These maps tended to focus on the individual traveler and highlighted the limitations of such a singular view of the landscape. John Smith’s map of the Chesapeake serves as an example: Smith placed himself prominently in the map and marked with little crosses the limits of his own journeys, highlighting to the map’s audience that they were seeing and hearing only what Smith saw and heard: some of it firsthand, some through verbal reports, but no more or less than Smith himself had encountered."),Fe=i(),F=r("p"),qt=s("John Lederer’s 1672 A Map of the Territory of Virginia likewise offers another excellent example of the published personal map of discovery. The geography of this map could in no way be separated from the individual’s particular experiences.

Although the dotted lines used to mark Lederer’s movements were not the most visually striking image on the map, they nonetheless provided the map with its overall shape. Rivers and mountains frame the trail and the map’s lettering aligns itself to Lederer’s route. The map offers almost no information beyond what Lederer experienced personally. In all, the map provided a fairly accurate record of Lederer’s experience but not the topography, showing the southern Piedmont as a landscape glimpsed only along the corridors Lederer traveled.

Eastern Carolina hardly appeared at all, despite being well known since at least the late-1500s maps of John White. But Lederer did not travel there, so the region did not appear on the map.

Anything that the map attempted to record beyond the traveler’s line of sight was based on verbal or other accounts of landscape lodged in the memories of other (primarily Native American) informants and occasionally drawn or retold to the mapmaker. Mostly these involved the landscape impressions and knowledge of Native travelers, whose concepts of landscape never easily fit with European ones and allowed only rudimentary “pidgin” cartographies which easily bore the marks of their creation.

Indeed, their frequency likely increased as European travelers became more and more common across the face of North America, driven by the expansion of European colonization in the Americas. (Edney 1999, 176). In particular, the trade between Indians and Europeans increased as the century wore on, creating new travelers and new sources of geographic information. The Indian trade provided mapmakers access to large reserves of human knowledge created by the movement of private traders, public agents, and untold thousands of Indian diplomats and informants. As France and Great Britain in particular jostled with each other for claims over eastern North America, they relied on the complex webs of personal, official, and economic relationships provided by the exchange of European manufactured goods for Native manufactured deerskins. Navigating this region, marked by the complex politics of Native America, proved tricky at all times. Traders thus relied on a set sequence of paths and places in order to best ensure safe passage and predictable futures. The sequence of places was the crucial safeguard against getting lost along the way.

A reprinted edition of George Hunter’s 1730 map of his travel to the Cherokees reveals the changing relationship between movement, mapping, and the map-reading public. Hunter was a surveyor who accompanied Sir Alexander Cumming on a diplomatic mission to enhance South Carolina’s (and Cumming’s own) standing among the Cherokees while at the same time diminishing the influence of the Virginia colony in that region. The map shows the party’s route along South Carolina’s primary trading path. The path followed the Santee River, across the headwaters of the Savannah River, and across the mountains to the Overhills Cherokees of present-day eastern Tennessee. Along the way, Hunter made note of village names and recorded some information about more distant areas (likely gained from traders).

Hunter marked distance with verbal notes, creating an itinerary of places between the starting point and the end point but based on impression more than precise measurement. In many ways, Hunter’s map functioned like a modern subway system map where stations are arranged in straight lines so that the rider knows which station will come next. The sequence of places mattered a great deal, but the topography beyond the path was little known. (Most of Hunter’s notes about areas beyond the path come from the vague “reports” he cites in the map’s legends.) To lose the path was therefore to risk getting lost in a large region. For this reason, Hunter’s “Journal of the Road” in the lower left exactly reproduces the same sequence of places going up to the Cherokees as returning. To find one’s way back to Charleston, one simply had to retrace one’s steps. Closer analysis of this map would no doubt reveal even more about the experience of travel in colonial America.

However, published maps were increasingly taking ideological and formal steps to diminish the idea of movement within their gridlines.

Here emerged the familiar form of the eighteenth-century map—the increasingly “plain” chart that was every bit as dependent on complex human interactions as earlier maps but that nonetheless tried to mask this dependence for numerous intellectual, political, and economic reasons. Rather than recognize their maps as the product of individuals’ limited range of vision, mapmakers emphasized the accuracy and collaborative nature of their maps. By assuring their audiences of the complete accuracy of their works, mapmakers could then use their maps in new ways: as settings in which European viewers could imagine the marches of historical figures and across which Europeans could plan future movements. The human movements that produced these maps (still completely necessary) were hidden from view. The result was a growing culture of map reading, where Anglo-American audiences could imagine themselves gazing from above at all manner of important events.

In other words, through various rhetorical and design strategies, eighteenth-century mapmakers helped train their audiences to see maps not as the result of past travels, but as tools of the reader’s vision to encourage future movements, both imagined and real.

The human movements that produced these maps (still completely necessary) were hidden from view. The result was a growing culture of map reading, where Anglo-American audiences could imagine themselves gazing from above at all manner of important events.

The maps themselves were the result of Surveyor General of the Northern District Samuel Holland’s coastal surveys of America and the publication was made possible by the enlistment of unnamed engravers and artists in London, so it is difficult to say with certainty that Des Barres was the sole visionary behind the maps. But whoever shaped the vision, there is little doubt that the American Neptune represents a different relationship to the movements and imaginations of source material, compiler/cartographer, and reader in the 1700s."),Pn.forEach(t),Pt=o(e),Ae=h(e,"P",{});var Sn=l(Ae);Sa=d(Sn,"The Atlantic Neptune used new visual approaches to create a visual separation between the information of humans and the supposedly fixed and unchanging landscape upon which humans operated. Des Barres and his artists included numerous legends and verbal descriptions right on the faces of their maps but, unlike earlier mapmakers, they isolated the text from the cartographic information. Whereas someone like Moll typically inserted their legends within the map’s grid lines and placed no borders around them, Des Barres isolated his legends within medallions drawn off-grid. The effect is a trompe l’oeil where the human knowledge appears as pieces of writing laid across the map, resting above it but not embedded within it (see maps in Hornsby, 138, 166, 189)."),Sn.forEach(t),St=o(e),Ee=h(e,"P",{});var Cn=l(Ee);Ca=d(Cn,"The Newberry’s collection of the Atlantic Neptune maps provides numerous examples of this technique but the 1777 map of Charleston, South Carolina, is a particularly striking example. Like the rest of the atlas, the map is primarily a nautical chart of the environs of Charleston, South Carolina, including sand bars and depth measurements. In this, it was much of a piece with Des Barres nautical charts of the northeastern North American coastline that formed the bulk of the Atlantic Neptune. Some land features (plantations, roads) are marked on the map but are blended together under a uniform brown wash. The meeting of water and land is the central feature of this map, save for a colorful inset in the map’s upper left."),Cn.forEach(t),Ct=o(e),Te=h(e,"P",{});var Nn=l(Te);Na=d(Nn,"Here, Des Barres went for an artistic touch over and above those provided elsewhere in the atlas. Rather than the usual harbor scenes with boats in the middle distance that characterized much of the trompe l’oeil insets in his other maps, this Charleston map included an untitled landscape view of the town as seen from the southern bank of the Ashley River. It was a bucolic, pastoral scene of livestock herders tending a few cattle resting on the sandy banks of the river. Keeping to form, the engraver did include a small sailing vessel (a “petiaugua” or local sailing vessel common along southeastern shores and associated with local exchange) but the view is from land rather than from a sea approach. The harbor of Charleston itself, one of the busiest in North America, has almost no ships. The hard work of rice, Carolina’s largest export, is missing from the scene entirely. The image therefore stands in sharp contrast to the bustling commercial scenes common to eighteenth-century cartouches (see the Fry-Jefferson or De Brahm maps for comparison)."),Nn.forEach(t),Nt=o(e),xe=h(e,"P",{});var Ln=l(xe);La=d(Ln,"The image is clearly meant to be read as almost completely separate from the map. This image is not linked to the map in any way. It was set off at an angle to the map’s grid, a bit of illusion to highlight the separation between the cartographic vision and the traveler’s vision. The map allows two views. One view is the cartographic: its precise delineation of a complex hydrography, measured and enumerated at all necessary points, authenticated from the most professional naval surveys (as the title indicates). The other view is that of the traveler, happening upon a restful scene after a trip overland. The two views are separated on this map as Des Barres makes a claim for the “proper” relationship between cartography and movement: maps can bring you to your destination, where you can then enjoy the local scenery. In 1777, Des Barres foreshadowed the tourist map and the complex relationship between cartography and movement that would help define the future United States as a country of movers and travelers."),Ln.forEach(t),Lt=o(e),Me=h(e,"P",{});var zn=l(Me);za=d(zn,"These few examples from the years of the American Revolution point the way towards new areas of investigation. The nineteenth century has long been recognized as the age when North Americans spent their efforts turning their grand ambitions into transcontinental realities. By examining the particular circumstances around late colonial maps in the British colonies, one has the chance to witness that continental ambition forming.
