Literary mappings that had been deemed to be metaphorical adaptations in American texts turn out to be well-rehearsed transcriptions of particular maps (Padrón 2004; Brückner 2006). Allusions to map genres, such as New World maps, became a standard reference for the way in which early modern authors envisioned unknown lands, processed the colonization of a vast continental expanse and numerous peoples, or reconciled personal desire for property with communal rules of ownership (Pagden 1994; Buell 1995; Newman 2012). Beginning in the late eighteenth-century, the growth of carto-literacy among authors and readers aligned even the most casual literary map reference with complex discursive patterns of power and reconnaissance, invoking narratological or poetic conventions that described, for example, dramatic action, points of view, the geographical architecture of settings, and above all the idea of subjective and social mobility (Muehrcke 1974; Anderson 1991; Turchi 2007; Padron 2007; Moretti 1995; Cooper and Gregory 2011; Wilkens 2013)."),Nl=d(),ia=i("p"),Xc=t("Guided by the critical approach of “literary cartography,” this essay examines the factor of movement in relation to actual maps that were published along with select prose writings that are today considered representative examples of the American literary canon.

Second, during the same decades that had literary historians debate the definition of the American canon, historians of cartography debated conventional map definitions, increasingly accepting maps as a intermedial construct tapping graphic, verbal, and performative modes of representation. Today, it is fair to say that major anthologies have not only redefined American literature in much broader and more inclusionary terms, but have now incorporated the occasional historical map along with personal letters, political pamphlets, poems, plays, and novels (Bercovitch 1994; Lauter 1984; Baym 1989; Jehlen and Warner 1996)."),Gl=d(),oa=i("p"),em=t("While map inserts are generally treated as illustrative contexts rather than texts, this essay builds on a bibliographic survey of “American” literature published between 1600 and 2000 which revealed that physical maps were a regular insert in diverse literary genres, especially in travel writing, didactic nonfiction (in particular when addressing immigrants), and fiction addressing children. Because mobility was central to genres like these, the essay explores the trope of movement broadly as an intermedial dialogue between literary text and cartographic paratext. To accomplish this, its primary goal is to offer a provisional (and thus not comprehensive) survey of nonfiction and fictional prose writings that either carried printed maps inside their pages and bindings or that are demonstrably informed by a specific map-text nexus. While territoriality, distance reading, and spatial thinking ostensibly inform all maps, be they graphic or literary in kind, the essay examines patterns of mobility that are mostly located at the intersection of a dialogic imagination with the goal of linking the map as the textual tool providing orientation and direction to various literary forms and readerly functions."),Hl=d(),ee=i("p"),tm=t("Last but not least, in order to describe the relationship between maps and movement as a mutually constitutive part of American literary history the essay borrows from conventional models of periodization and geography.

Authors frequently struggled for words that were capable of reporting unfamiliar plants and objects, thus revealing formal and conceptual uncertainties about how to describe the experience of what literary historians have dubbed the “marvels” or “wonder” of the New World (Greenblatt 1992; Campbell 1999; Bauer 2003).

In the narrative, Smith assigns himself controversial powers demanding, under the guise of offering practical advice on how to colonize (“plant”) New England properly, the kind of trust and authority that is usually reserved for sovereigns and aristocratic government agents. In the map, he takes this sense of authority one step further: he not only rebaptizes native places with English names, such as “New London,” “The River Charles,” or “Oxford,” but inserts the author’s portrait in the margins; accompanied by a laudatory poem, Smith’s self-image appears in the symbolic space that mapmakers usually reserved for heraldry or other tokens of homage celebrating royalty or high-ranking sponsors supportive of risky Atlantic expeditions."),ql=d(),ca=i("p"),Hm=t("While in principle the genre of the travel report remains relatively unchanged during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the maps that accompanied them suggested a shift in compositional direction.

At the same time, the reports experimented with linguistic and literary elements in the effort of rendering the unfamiliar in more familiar terms. While early travel accounts introduced to the English lexicon neologisms borrowed from European and Native American languages, on the whole (and perhaps unsurprisingly) they applied a Euro-centric approach to their literary craft: formal travel reports and informal diaries packed the American experience into established literary forms that were inflected by the literary protocols of historiography, the religious conversion narrative, and the encyclopedic method emerging from the natural sciences.

Moving from simple inscription to complex imagery, travel reports incorporated and/or imitated place names and coordinates, wordy map inserts and allegorical cartouche imagery in order to better represent particular spaces, materials, and peoples. On occasion the authors’ preoccupation with maps had its pitfalls: For example, when European travelers lost their way because they had naively followed Native American maps, which, unlike Western cartography, marked places in spatio-temporal terms (Warhus 1997; Brückner 2006; Hollis 2011); or, when natural conditions, like shifting coastal sands, thwarted the authors’ desire for establishing literal and figurative boundaries as described in William Byrd’s "),Dr=i("em"),Lp=t("History of the Dividing Line"),Sp=t(" (1730; Franklin 1979); or, when the map as such was deemed to be a tool of representation superior to the English language as suggested by Thomas Jefferson’s first two chapters in his "),qr=i("em"),xp=t("Notes on the State of Virginia"),Bp=t(" (1784; Brückner 2006).

These maps track the movement of texts, characters, and readers in their historical moment spaces, thus suggestively making the representation of the map advance as the graphic container of literary history (Baym 1989; Lauter 2006; Alberti 2006). Indeed, if we accept Franco Moretti’s approach to the European novel, the conceptual tools of literary cartography emerge as a productive critical tool because only by mapping the text (and Moretti really wants us to use graphic maps) will we “bring … to light relations that would otherwise remain hidden” (Moretti 2005, 3). With the aid of the computational powers of “literary GIS” applications, new methodological models are now able to recover lost or overlooked map-based movements in American literature.

Allusions to map genres, such as New World maps, became a standard reference for the way in which early modern authors envisioned unknown lands, processed the colonization of a vast continental expanse and numerous peoples, or reconciled personal desire for property with communal rules of ownership (Pagden 1994; Buell 1995; Newman 2012). Beginning in the late eighteenth-century, the growth of carto-literacy among authors and readers aligned even the most casual literary map reference with complex discursive patterns of power and reconnaissance, invoking narratological or poetic conventions that described, for example, dramatic action, points of view, the geographical architecture of settings, and above all the idea of subjective and social mobility (Muehrcke 1974; Anderson 1991; Turchi 2007; Padron 2007; Moretti 1995; Cooper and Gregory 2011; Wilkens 2013)."),n0.forEach(r),Nl=c(s),ia=o(s,"P",{});var s0=n(ia);Xc=a(s0,"Guided by the critical approach of “literary cartography,” this essay examines the factor of movement in relation to actual maps that were published along with select prose writings that are today considered representative examples of the American literary canon.

Second, during the same decades that had literary historians debate the definition of the American canon, historians of cartography debated conventional map definitions, increasingly accepting maps as a intermedial construct tapping graphic, verbal, and performative modes of representation. Today, it is fair to say that major anthologies have not only redefined American literature in much broader and more inclusionary terms, but have now incorporated the occasional historical map along with personal letters, political pamphlets, poems, plays, and novels (Bercovitch 1994; Lauter 1984; Baym 1989; Jehlen and Warner 1996)."),s0.forEach(r),Gl=c(s),oa=o(s,"P",{});var l0=n(oa);em=a(l0,"While map inserts are generally treated as illustrative contexts rather than texts, this essay builds on a bibliographic survey of “American” literature published between 1600 and 2000 which revealed that physical maps were a regular insert in diverse literary genres, especially in travel writing, didactic nonfiction (in particular when addressing immigrants), and fiction addressing children. Because mobility was central to genres like these, the essay explores the trope of movement broadly as an intermedial dialogue between literary text and cartographic paratext. To accomplish this, its primary goal is to offer a provisional (and thus not comprehensive) survey of nonfiction and fictional prose writings that either carried printed maps inside their pages and bindings or that are demonstrably informed by a specific map-text nexus. While territoriality, distance reading, and spatial thinking ostensibly inform all maps, be they graphic or literary in kind, the essay examines patterns of mobility that are mostly located at the intersection of a dialogic imagination with the goal of linking the map as the textual tool providing orientation and direction to various literary forms and readerly functions."),l0.forEach(r),Hl=c(s),ee=o(s,"P",{});var Ca=n(ee);tm=a(Ca,"Last but not least, in order to describe the relationship between maps and movement as a mutually constitutive part of American literary history the essay borrows from conventional models of periodization and geography.

But when he asks the question “how many maps, in the descriptive or geographical sense, might be needed to deal exhaustively with a given space, to code and decode all its meanings and contents?” (85), the answer for readers of American literature despite the scarcity of the physical artifact would have to be “many.” Inspired by spatial theories like Lefebvre’s recent approaches to American literature tend to be informed by critical methodologies whose discussion of maps and mapping has provided new perspective and energy to literary criticism more generally (Brückner 2016)."),_M.forEach(r),_h=c(s),_a=o(s,"P",{});var TM=n(_a);Fg=a(TM,"Studies invested in “literary cartography” frequently invoke the terms and protocols developed by, for example, Michel de Certeau (maps are “a memorandum prescribing actions”; de Certeau 1984, 120), Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari (“the map does not reproduce an unconscious closed in upon itself; it constructs the unconscious”; Deleuze 1987, 12), or Jean Baudrillard (“the map precedes the territory”; Baudrillard 1994, 1). As the discourse of maps has come to pervade discussions of literary form and the tools of literary analysis, it is only a short leap to align older residual discussions of the factor of movement with the new critical terms of a modern mapping function, reconciling the classical rhetorical “topos” with the early modern neologism of “plot,” the early modern quest or pilgrimage motif with poststructural uses of “narrative,” and modern spatial idioms linking “travel” and “exploring” to “colonization” and “decolonization.” Indeed, it was the representational power of maps that has by now encouraged literary scholars to speculate how maps mobilized American literary culture figuratively and literally. If we consider Benedict Anderson’s critique of nationalism in relation to the history of print culture and Edward Said’s exploration of culture and imperialism, not to mention more recent discussions of transnational literature and identity, the discourse of maps and the language of mobility provide a fertile contact zone for addressing movement in a wide range of American literatures across time and space (Anderson 1991; Said 1993)."),TM.forEach(r),Th=c(s),Q=o(s,"P",{});var Pe=n(Q);Ug=a(Pe,"New editions of "),no=o(Pe,"EM",{});var CM=n(no);zg=a(CM,"The Norton Anthology of American Literature"),CM.forEach(r),Jg=a(Pe," or "),so=o(Pe,"EM",{});var PM=n(so);Dg=a(PM,"The"),PM.forEach(r),qg=c(Pe),lo=o(Pe,"EM",{});var LM=n(lo);Og=a(LM,"Heath Anthology of American Literature"),LM.forEach(r),Vg=a(Pe," still include maps in the endpapers (“North America to 1700” in front and “The United States: A Literary View” in the back).

Indeed, if we accept Franco Moretti’s approach to the European novel, the conceptual tools of literary cartography emerge as a productive critical tool because only by mapping the text (and Moretti really wants us to use graphic maps) will we “bring … to light relations that would otherwise remain hidden” (Moretti 2005, 3). With the aid of the computational powers of “literary GIS” applications, new methodological models are now able to recover lost or overlooked map-based movements in American literature.
