  return `<p>Nineteenth-century railroad maps occupy a pivotal, transformative place in the history of North American transportation and travel cartography, not unlike the railroads they mapped. Railroads enjoyed an outsized place in the history and mythology of Western expansion during the nineteenth century. In the United States the completion of the transcontinental railroad in 1869, for example, is even today viewed as an event that not only brought two coasts closer to each other, but which also bound together a nation broken by a destructive civil war, and pointed its fractured people towards a future of union, progress, and prosperity. Samuel Bowles journeyed across the continent in 1865 to prepare a guide for those who would follow the transcontinental route. Significantly, Bowles’ <em>The Pacific Railroad—Open: How to Go. What to See</em> (Boston, 1869) described the completion of the transcontinental route in cartographic terms, as “the unrolling of a new map…a revelation of new empire, the creation of a new civilization.” Bowles’ imaginary map embodied a vision of unity and progress, but in reality, railroad maps of many varieties, while echoing these major themes, also served more mundane purposes. Indeed, the specific goals of these utilitarian devices created a new cartography.</p>
<p>All maps, of course, are rhetorical in nature, selecting, portraying, centering, and phrasing in a way to achieve their purposes. But few have done so in a more striking way than nineteenth-century American railroad maps. A decade after Bowles announced the prospect of epic journeys from the Atlantic to the Pacific, the Rand McNally Company, a newcomer to map publishing, looked at railroad cartography in a different light. A pamphlet published in 1879 by this Chicago printing firm specializing in on railroad work, explained how railroad officials realized the importance of map design in structuring a map to achieve their purposes. An experienced draughtsman played a key role in railroad cartography because “the ‘designing’ of a good map involves the exercise of tact and ingenuity” in addition to the considerable skills that went into the drawing of any map. “The majority of railroad maps have some ‘peculiar design’ hidden under the careful pencil of the draughtsman.…The various friendly interests must be shown to best advantage, and the rival interests disposed of in a manner that ‘no fellow can find out’” (quoted in Modelski, <em>Railroad Maps of North America,</em> xix; see Maps <a href="/american-railroad-maps-1828-1876/1854-northern-rr#top">5</a>, <a href="/american-railroad-maps-1828-1876/1876-penn-rr#top">9</a>, and <a href="/american-railroad-maps-1828-1876/1873-atsf-kansas#top">10</a>). Railroad mapping, in other words, often involved manipulating geography for commercial advantage.</p>
<p>On the other hand, certain types of railroad maps often demanded high levels of accuracy and consistency. The “blueprints” which guided the construction of a railroad landscape drawn by engineers and surveyors demonstrate close attention to topography and precise measurement. The operation of any railroad also depended on trustworthy maps. In 1854 the Board of Directors of the Sacket’s Harbor and Saratoga Rail Road, then under construction, questioned whether the railroad grades shown on the engineering maps they had commissioned (see <a href="/american-railroad-maps-1828-1876/1828-survey-boston#top">Map 1</a> for a similar example) were too steep to economically haul freight in a competitive market. The maps, in the words of the committee, raised the question “if the road when done would be good for nothing?” (<em>Report of the Committee to Investigate the Affairs of the Company</em>, 1854). Given the capital resources at risk, these types of railroad maps deserve a high level of confidence as guides to past geographies. We thus have two ideal types of railroad maps, those willfully distorted contrasted with those made to be as accurate as possible. But there are many stations between these two terminals.</p>
<p>As documents of the place of movement in American history and culture, railroad maps have at least three major strengths. First, and most straightforwardly, they assist us in reconstructing past geographies. Nineteenth-century examples are superb records of the evolution and growth of the nation’s transportation network during a period of rapid expansion. At the smallest map scales, some (Maps <a href="/american-railroad-maps-1828-1876/1836-vision-us-rr#top">2</a>, <a href="/american-railroad-maps-1828-1876/1854-northern-rr#top">5</a>, <a href="/american-railroad-maps-1828-1876/1854-rr-us#top">7</a>, and <a href="/american-railroad-maps-1828-1876/1876-penn-rr#top">9</a>) provide an excellent overview of the projected and actual growth of the national rail network, its relationship to other forms of transportation, and to economic and political history. At larger scales (Maps <a href="/american-railroad-maps-1828-1876/1828-survey-boston#top">1</a>, <a href="/american-railroad-maps-1828-1876/1847-boston-worcester#top">3</a>, <a href="/american-railroad-maps-1828-1876/1854-illinois-land-grant#top">4</a>, <a href="/american-railroad-maps-1828-1876/1853-pacific-rr#top">6</a>, and <a href="/american-railroad-maps-1828-1876/1872-track-book#top">8</a>) we gain a more intimate sense of their influence upon local and regional landscapes and events. Second, as we have seen, they are remarkable windows into the rhetorical nature and instrumental nature of maps, and by extension into the commercial and economic history of American railroads. Third, and more broadly, they illustrate the many roles that transportation and cartography played in the spatial transformations of American society that followed from the emergence of the United States as a transcontinental nation with an industrial economy. A modern reader of nineteenth-century railroad maps needs only to put on the shoes, so to speak, of those people who conceived, built, financed, operated, rode, used, administered, regulated, or benefited by the trains to see how much maps were part of this story.</p>
<p>Four keys are required to unlock the secrets of these old documents. First, the reader needs to place the document at hand into the proper category. This is not always easy, because any map might be used in a variety of ways. But start with the apparent intent: “Why was this map made?” The second key relates the map under consideration to the land itself. Here other maps, such as topographic maps, should be consulted to enrich our understanding of the geography behind the railroad map. Pictures, drawings, diagrams, sketches and the like are also useful in this respect. Indeed, a site visit, if possible, might also bring rich rewards. Third, other documents will need to be consulted to construct a historical context for the map. Here secondary sources will be helpful and dry statistics should not be overlooked. A map sometimes brings these dry bones to life. Indeed, by combining data and observations drawn from the map itself, and combining it with other information, a researcher is on the way to integrating the cartography into the general narrative. Finally, the fourth key unlocks the door by bringing insights garnered from the history of cartography to bear on the map. These perspectives remind the reader of the nature of maps, their advantages and limitations, their factual appearance and yet highly rhetorical structure, their selective nature and inevitable distortions, indeed, how purpose, intent, and argument shape their context and appearance.</p>
<p>The history of American railroad mapping is complex, and it may be useful to organize our appreciation of it through the suggestion of a general chronology (see the railroad timeline) and a typology.</p>

<h3>Beginnings</h3>
<p>The earliest American railroad maps, made roughly from the late 1820s to the early 1850s, illustrate early efforts to finance and construct railroads. Most were of limited geographical extent. These early routes were concentrated in the Atlantic states, though construction of outliers beyond the Appalachians, such as the Louisville, Cincinnati, and Chesterton Rail Road, accelerated in the 1840s. General maps from this period (<a href="/american-railroad-maps-1828-1876/1836-vision-us-rr#top">Map 2</a>) show that railroads competed with and were often conceived as connections to canals, waterways, and turnpikes. Perhaps of greatest interest to the researcher are the more detailed maps made by the surveyors of these early rail routes (<a href="/american-railroad-maps-1828-1876/1828-survey-boston#top">Map 1</a>). These detail the obstacles that terrain and finance presented to advocates of this new technology. General maps of the national transportation system made as accompaniments to guides for travelers and migrants were fairly common by the 1840s, and interest in rail travel was sufficiently well developed in the eastern states to support the publication of detailed maps and guides to specific routes (<a href="/american-railroad-maps-1828-1876/1847-boston-worcester#top">Map 3</a>).</p>
${validate_component(Image, "Image").$$render($$result, { index: "2" }, {}, {})}
<h3>Flowering</h3>
<p>The 1850s were a pivotal period in American railroad and railroad map history. In the eastern states and in much of the Midwest the rail network expanded rapidly and had begun to shoulder aside the dependence of travelers and many shippers on canals and waterways (<a href="/american-railroad-maps-1828-1876/1854-rr-us#top">Map 7</a>). The acquisition of the Oregon Country and former Mexican lands from Texas to California by the late 1840s pushed the federal government to promote the extension of the national railroad network into the Great Plains and thence to the Pacific. Congress acted decisively in two ways. First, it established the practice (which would continue into the early 1880s) of granting fledgling railroad companies large tracts of federal land, the sale of which would support railroad construction and promote the settlement and development of the regions the railroads served (<a href="/american-railroad-maps-1828-1876/1854-illinois-land-grant#top">Map 4</a>). Second, Congress authorized a massive exploration of the Trans-Mississippi West by the War Department to determine the best possible routes for a transcontinental railroad. These Pacific Railroad Surveys (1853-55) (Maps <a href="/american-railroad-maps-1828-1876/1854-northern-rr#top">5</a>-<a href="/american-railroad-maps-1828-1876/1853-pacific-rr#top">6</a>) mark the beginning of a great era of systematic scientific exploration of the West, stalled, if only temporarily, by the Civil War. These surveys set the stage for the actual construction of several transcontinental routes in the 1860s-1880s, a period of great vigor in railroad expansion. We find the first examples in this decade of railroad maps designed specifically to promote the activities of and points-of-view of specific railroads and regional interests (Maps <a href="/american-railroad-maps-1828-1876/1854-illinois-land-grant#top">4</a>-<a href="/american-railroad-maps-1828-1876/1854-northern-rr#top">5</a>), a process that would accelerate in the decades after the Civil War.</p>
${validate_component(Image, "Image").$$render($$result, { index: "3" }, {}, {})}
<h3>Continental and Market Expansion</h3>
<p>The decade immediately following the Civil War saw the realization and extension of the ambitious plans made before the war. The first transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869, and additional transcontinental routes were underway by the centennial year of 1876. Some rail investment went to the reconstruction of southern railroads destroyed and disrupted by war (<a href="/american-railroad-maps-1828-1876/1828-survey-boston#top">Map 8</a>), but the greatest growth took place on in the Trans-Mississippi West. Fueled by the stimulus of the federal land grants, railroads were now playing a major role in the migration to and settlement of the Great Plains (<a href="/american-railroad-maps-1828-1876/1876-penn-rr#top">Map 9</a>), and the mountains and Pacific coast beyond. Speculation, fierce competition, the high costs of rail construction among these railroads resulted in several spectacular financial failures among railroad companies, notably the bankruptcy of the Northern Pacific Railroad in 1873, but other railroads, such as the Pennsylvania Railroad (<a href="/american-railroad-maps-1828-1876/1873-atsf-kansas#top">Map 10</a>), thrived by absorbing or working cooperatively with their rivals. Cartographically, this was a period of great experimentation and innovation in the design and use of maps in railroad advertising and promotion (Maps <a href="/american-railroad-maps-1828-1876/1876-penn-rr#top">9</a>-<a href="/american-railroad-maps-1828-1876/1873-atsf-kansas#top">10</a>). These innovations were spearheaded by new publishers specializing in the field such as Rand McNally.</p>
<p>Another way of thinking about railroad cartography is to arrange the entire corpus of such materials into categories according to their purpose. In developing such a classification morphology naturally emerges because purpose directly influences the structure, form, and format of the maps. We might posit five broad categories of maps: (1) Initial maps, those used before a railroad is put into operation; (2) Working maps used to keep the trains running; (3) Promotional maps published to bring a particular railroad to the attention of the general public; (4) Travelers’ maps produced by commercial publishers that treated all railroads equally; and (5) Booster maps produced by states, cities, and towns in the railroad age which promoted the interests of the sponsoring organization. Most railroad maps would fit into one of these categories, but a stubborn minority might resist easy pigeonholing: News maps or maps of abandoned routes, for example. And then there are general maps of many types produced during the railroad age which used the tracks to give shape to the American landscape on a national, regional, state, and local level.</p>

<h3>Initial Maps</h3>
<p>All railroads started with an idea, and as such owe their conception to a mental map. To convey the idea to others, however, paper came into play. At first it might have been a sketch on the back of an envelope but as the proposal took shape and the project attracted some support, a civil engineer or a surveyor was often hired to head a team to compile an accurate survey. The data gathered by these efforts usually appeared in a printed report, often summarized by a map (<a href="/american-railroad-maps-1828-1876/1828-survey-boston#top">Map 1</a>). Profiles illustrating the grade and elevation of the route normally accompanied the map. Employing a large enough scale to portray necessary details, the mapmaker, often the engineer in charge of the effort, focused on the right-of-way, excluding most details beyond the immediate vicinity of the proposed route. Sometimes several alternative routes were presented to compare costs involved in initial construction versus the operating expenditures expected down the road. More bridges, for example, might reduce grades and straighten routes, but they were expensive to erect.</p>
<p>The initial survey provided only a general idea for a route. The actual process of construction required more detailed plans. Construction plans on paper seldom survived the rough use in the field and the continual process of revision, however. Although multiple copies might have been made at the time, they were usually not printed because they were so large and unwieldy. The usually smaller initial surveys were better suited than construction documents to attract investors or to inform the general public about the route and how it fitted into the territory. Sometimes they were hand colored and transformed into attractive presentation copies. Copies could also be folded and tipped into a prospectus or an annual report and hence enjoyed a greatly enhanced chance of survival.</p>
<p>Thus the initial survey maps often saw double duty, addressing the engineering concerns for which they were made, but also persuading investors to take up stock in the company. Later, companies with some resources at hand would produce more elaborate prospectus maps, often to solicit financial support from the towns located along the right-of-way. These maps usually covered much more territory on each side of the route, perhaps suggesting branch lines or even an alternative route if enough financial assistance was forthcoming from towns originally left off the main line. Once a railroad was built and in operation, however, financial interests sought maps from independent sources such as Henry Varnum Poor (<a href="/american-railroad-maps-1828-1876/1854-rr-us#top">Map 7</a>). Prospectus maps often addressed the general public as well, especially when the prospective railroad hoped to sell stock or bonds to cities and towns along the way. Connecting the trackage with a potentially supportive community became an essential purpose of these maps.</p>
<p>Two additional types of initial survey maps should be noted, both of which are most clearly noted in the early proposals for a transcontinental railroad. Individual promoters saw railroads as a means of advancing national power and economic progress. One type of survey map projected individual railroads developing into a national system, embodying the vision of a contemporary school of political economy. (<a href="/american-railroad-maps-1828-1876/1836-vision-us-rr#top">Map 2</a>). Edwin F. Johnson’s propagandistic “Map of the Proposed Northern Route” for the transcontinental railroad in 1853 (<a href="/american-railroad-maps-1828-1876/1854-northern-rr#top">Map 5</a>) would fall into this category.</p>
<p>The maps produced by the various Pacific Railroad Surveys (<a href="/american-railroad-maps-1828-1876/1853-pacific-rr#top">Map 6</a>) constitute a second special type of initial map. Conceived on a much broader canvas than the typical railroad survey, these efforts, following four wide pathways from the Mississippi Valley to the Pacific Ocean, gathered data on the history, botany, zoology, geology, ethnography, and paleontology of the Great West, and produced maps more akin to those published by scientific expeditions than engineering surveys. Funded by the US Government, these surveys underscored the developmental nature of much of the railroad building in the United States, especially on the Western routes. These tracks did not tap existing economic resources but provided a means to create them. In a real sense, the Pacific Railroad Surveys penetrated distant lands and opened up new visions of what America was and what it could become.</p>

<h3>Working Maps for Internal Use</h3>
<p>Once the tracks were set in place and the trains started running, a variety of maps facilitated their operation. Each task required a special type of map. Depot agents selling tickets needed a picture of the entire line and its various connections. Trackage maintenance supervisors, on the other hand, needed detailed, large-scale maps to plan their work. Railroad archives are sometimes crowded with plans, blueprints, diagrams, and the like for specific structures such as stations, bridges, and freight-houses. These were kept in the main office in case they would be needed at a later date.</p>
<p>Large-scale track charts, usually in manuscript form, were often bound into large trackage atlases. Copies sent to the main office may not have been used very often and were soon out of date. Working documents in the field, however, seldom survived because they were literally worn out by continual revision and constant use. When they do survive, these detailed maps are very useful in reconstructing railroad corridors of the past, especially as they incorporate notes and images on the surrounding landscape (<a href="/american-railroad-maps-1828-1876/1872-track-book#top">Map 8</a>).</p>
<p>All railroads were major landowners, and most had special land departments in charge of buying additional parcels, selling others, and generally looking after the company’s real estate. These offices depended on surveys, subdivisions, boundary maps, and plats of railroad and adjacent properties of various types. Legal necessities dictated carefully maintained files of these documents, occasionally augmented by specially created display maps if a legal dispute should lead to court.</p>
<p>From the start, railroad companies published maps addressed primarily to stockholders, prospective purchasers of the company’s bonds, and public officials who might be in a position to advance the interests of this particular railroad. Many of these maps took up large sheets to be displayed as wall maps or folded into annual reports. Presentation copies were often hand colored and pasted onto canvas to hang on rollers, or folded within ornate covers. These maps almost always showed the entire route over which the particular company operated trains and often placed the company’s trackage into a wide geographical context indicating connecting routes. Eventually, travelers could expect to find this type of a wall map exhibited in all passenger depots.</p>
<p>These system maps had cousins in the legal files in the main offices of a railroad company. As a railroad built branch lines, purchased other railroads, or secured operating rights over other lines, maps became a convenient way of visualizing these legalities. Although prosaic in appearance, these maps clarified who owned which segments of the system, how far operating rights extended, or which parts of the railroad’s real estate secured loans and mortgages. In addition, managers sometimes required special maps such as those made in response to natural disasters such as floods, or traffic flow maps made to help plan future improvements.</p>
${validate_component(Image, "Image").$$render($$result, { index: "7" }, {}, {})}
<h3>Promotional Maps</h3>
<p>Railroads in the United States were almost always private concerns, conceived, financed, built, and operated by joint-stock companies. Their success depended on attracting patronage from the general public. It is not surprising, therefore, that advertising to encourage use of particular routes by passengers and shippers appeared at an early date, especially in newspapers. Because the earliest trains ran between a limited number of places, notices placed in each newspaper along the way would reach almost the entire supporting public. Posters, broadsides, and leaflets also reached out to this audience, often employing graphic embellishments to attract attention.</p>
<p>Maps, however, did not seem to fit into these early railroad promotional materials for several reasons. First, there was little need for a map showing the route from Boston to Lowell, for example, only twenty-six miles away. Maps were also costly to produce and took up expensive space, especially in newspapers where one paid by the line. Moreover, if one wanted to use an illustration to attract attention, drawings of locomotives puffing smoke and pulling cars would be better than a map.</p>
<p>Maps did not usually appear on company-sponsored publications until the 1850s and 1860s. The emergence of maps to promote and facilitate travel by rail came first as supplemental information on travel guides that centered their attention on canals, steamboat routes, and turnpikes. The 1834 “Map of the Railroads and Canals, Finished, Unfinished, and in Contemplation in the United States” produced by William Morris for the <em>Railroad Journal</em> is a case in point. One of the earliest comprehensive transportation maps of the nation, it emphasized canals. Eleven profiles at the edges of the map show the elevations of canals and only three feature railroads, usually as an extension of a canal. There is no map on the earliest surviving separately published piece of American railroad advertising, also published in 1834, a handbill promoting New York’s Mohawk &amp; Hudson Railroad, a short line providing passengers more direct access from Albany to the Erie Canal. But as the length of the railroad lines increased and as branch lines and connecting routes multiplied, maps, especially simple ones, became useful features on advertisements. Timetables became necessary as railroads increased the frequency of their daily operations. As railroads expanded their destinations or points of connection, maps became desirable timetable supplements.</p>
<p>With the growth of America’s railroad network, the increasing wealth of the railroad companies, and the stimulus of heightened competition, railroad maps became more elaborate. Advances in printing press design and paper manufacturing were accompanied by the introduction of lithography, wax engraving, and knowledge of ways to shape maps to the advantage of particular routes. Technological advances, acuity in designing maps for advertising purposes, and consumer needs for informative guides to rail travel all came together in the 1860s to create a revolution in the industry’s advertising. The result was the railroad map as we have come to know it. These often enthusiastic expressions of nationalism, American progress, and prosperity became classic Americana, trophies for map collectors and scholars, and loaded with imagery and data for historians and historical geographers. Rand McNally in Chicago perfected the type, but other firms around the country also supplied the market.</p>
<p>In 1874 the Chicago firm produced its first railroad promotion map on a grand scale for the Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul Railway (CM&amp;StP). The 13½ x 17½ inch sheet was folded so that the verso contained ten sections, six of which were devoted to the tabular timetables which had become standard railroad fare. One panel advertised the ease of connections to New York and points east, highlighting the convenience of using one of the company’s own “superior palace sleeping cars” which would switch lines in Chicago so passengers from the East would have no need to change trains on their way to the inviting scenery pictured on the two cover panels: Views of the Wisconsin Dells. The remaining panel featured a map of the “Business District of Chicago,” pointing out the various railroad terminals in the city for passengers wanting to make other connections. The front side of Rand McNally’s sheet featured a colorful map of the CM&amp;StP and its connecting routes, with the company’s tracks marked by bold, dark lines. All the stations are labeled on the map, placed at an angle with the names repeated in alphabetical order in columns flanking the map.</p>
<p>The classic Rand McNally production of this era might be the “General Map of the Pennsylvania Railroad,” which was tipped into a pamphlet given away at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia (<a href="/american-railroad-maps-1828-1876/1876-penn-rr#top">Map 9</a>). It pictures the United States railroad system in its entirety with an inset world map centered on the Los Angeles meridian.</p>
<p>A special type of promotional map issued by land-grant railroads accompanied the companies’ efforts to sell lands to farmers and ranchers. Often called “settlers’ maps,” these resembled time-tables in that one side would feature an attractive state or regional map showing the location of the real estate while the panels on the verso would describe and picture the land in very favorable terms. In place of time tables, a detailed text provided specific directions on how to reach the area, select a farm, purchase the land, and get started in a new location (<a href="/american-railroad-maps-1828-1876/1873-atsf-kansas#top">Map 10</a>).</p>
<p>The Illinois Central, the nation’s first major land-grant railroad, pioneered in developing settlers’ maps of various types (<a href="/american-railroad-maps-1828-1876/1854-illinois-land-grant#top">Map 4</a>). Many of these were published in foreign languages for distribution overseas or in ethnic neighborhoods in America cities. Railroads without land grants such as the older eastern companies also sought to attract factories and businesses to their service areas, setting up development offices to promote economic expansion which would benefit the lines down the road. Maps showing available sites for manufacturing facilities or lots for sale in business districts also often appeared under railroad sponsorship.</p>

<h3>Commercial Maps for Public Affairs and Travelers’ Aids</h3>
<p>Commercial publishers issued “railroad maps” before individual companies used cartography to reach the general public. Morris’s 1834 “Map of the Railroads and Canals…in the United States” might be the patriarch of this type of map, but it probably served more in the area of public affairs than aiding travelers, alerting the nation to the emergence and availability of a nascent transportation system rather than helping travelers get from one place to another. General guides for travelers published by New York- and Philadelphia-based publishers such as H. S. Tanner, Samuel Augustus Mitchell, John Disturnell, and J.G. Colton included similar maps of the transportation system from the late 1830s. Some of the various railroad guides (collections of timetables for various routes) that appeared around 1840 began to include maps of individual lines as well as a comprehensive national map when the competition between these publications intensified in the 1850s.</p>
<p>After the completion of the transcontinental railroad in 1869, a map publisher’s catalogue was not considered complete without an entry for a large-size national railroad map. Gaylord Watson published several such items in New York in the 1870s, the most elaborate of which was the huge (thirty-five by fifty-seven inches) hand-colored “Centennial American Republic and Railroad Map of the United States” (1875), an expensive wall decoration similar to the one the Pennsylvania Railroad was giving away for free (<a href="/american-railroad-maps-1828-1876/1876-penn-rr#top">Map 9</a>). Watson’s sheet included the complete text of the Declaration of Independence, a view of the national capitol, and a portrait of George Washington, among other national symbols, while the Pennsylvania Railroad made a corresponding point by simply including a world map as an inset.</p>
<p>Passengers had been served by a variety of local compilations of timetables since the 1840s but these were dwarfed by the <em>Travellers Official Railway Guide</em>, which began its long publishing career in New York in 1868. This guide aimed to be national in scope and included many maps. Soon afterward Rand, McNally entered the field, ensuring that maps would become a regular feature in these comprehensive railroad guides, eventually appearing alongside almost every timetable, and pushing the size of these volumes to over a thousand pages.</p>
${validate_component(Image, "Image").$$render($$result, { index: "9" }, {}, {})}
<h3>Booster Maps</h3>
<p>Because the United States was so large and its railroads so numerous, national railroad maps had only limited value to prospective passengers. More typically, commercial railroad maps focused on one region, a particular state, or even a particular vacation spot such as Niagara Falls. Here the field was soon dominated by free booster maps given away to prospective visitors or settlers by particular cities, states, and attractions. Such maps tended to emphasize the accessibility by rail and centrality of the sponsoring institution or destination, even when these locations were geographically marginal. Edward D. Mansfield’s pamphlet, <em>Exposition of the Natural Position of Mackinaw City</em> (1857), included an early example, a large foldout “Map illustrating the Canada and Northern Pacific and Other Proposed Railroads” produced by John Disturnell in New York. Mansfield assured his readers that Mackinaw City was “the most reliable point for investment and settlement now available in the West or North.” Although a few railroad maps of this type appeared before 1876, the golden age of the travel brochure and the booster pamphlet accompanied by one or more railroad maps, lay ahead, reaching into the twentieth century.</p>
<p>When telling the story of the United States between 1828 and 1876, railroads take the center stage. As Michel Chevalier toured the United States in 1834 he marveled at the prospect of a nation crisscrossed by railroads. Everywhere he traveled Americans talked about railroads. “The benefits of the invention are so palpable to their practical good sense that they endeavor to make an application of it everywhere and to everything, rightly or wrongly,” he told his countrymen in France. He even produced a map to bolster his argument that the Americans were constructing a national railroad system (<a href="/american-railroad-maps-1828-1876/1836-vision-us-rr#top">Map 2</a>), something he wanted France to emulate.</p>
<p>Near the end of our period, George H. Daniels issued a prospectus for a new railroad, complete with an initial map. To put the weight of recent history behind <em>The Chicago &amp; Pacific Railroad</em> (1873), Daniels quoted Schuyler Colfax, the recent Vice-President of the United States: “All experience in this rapidly-growing country has proven that the locomotive is not only the civilizer, but the developer of our States and Territories,” the Indiana politician concluded. As the railroads invite immigration, he continued, “villages and cities spring up, agriculture and mechanic arts thrive, water-power is utilized, manufactures are established, resources are developed, business is literally created,” and, we might add, one can see it all on the maps, if one has eyes to see. One map will not do. Every railroad has its own history and its own cartographic record. Each line must be seen as part of a larger national transportation system. In the end, as the Pennsylvania Railroad realized in 1876, one even needed a world map to tell the whole story.</p>

<h4>Further Reading</h4>
<p>Any study of American railroads is burdened by an immense storehouse of primary source material found in the archives of individual companies. These often include records of other lines taken over by the major trunk lines. Thus a document from a small entity such as the New Orleans, Jackson, and Great Northern Rail Road (NOJ&amp;GNRR: <a href="/american-railroad-maps-1828-1876/1872-track-book#top">Map 8</a>) is found in the Illinois Central Railroad archives in the Newberry Library. Sometimes there are detailed finding aids to guide research in these collections, but the best way to get into them is a conversation with the curator. In some cases the annual reports to stockholders, read in sequence, will also provide helpful guidance. If one wants to develop an archival context for a particular map, consulting the relevant annual reports might be a useful place to start.</p>
<p>Most readers, however, will not want to spend the time and energy needed for primary research and will turn to secondary sources. Once again, the literature is enormous, divided into books and articles. Again, taking the Rothas track book as an example, one would consult general histories of the Illinois Central Railroad, which eventually acquired the NOJ&amp;GNRR. Two such studies by Stover (1955) and Frey (1988) would bring Thomas D. Clark’s 1936 book on <em>A Pioneer Southern Railroad: From New Orleans to Cairo</em> to your attention. This monograph tells the story of how ten smaller lines eventually were combined to create a southern route for the Illinois Central Railroad. Chapter four is devoted to the NOJ&amp;GNRR.</p>
<p>Articles are another useful secondary source but they are much more difficult to find, locate, and procure by interlibrary loan. Again, a research librarian would be helpful in suggesting bibliographies and search engines based on the histories of railroads in general as well as guides to state history, business concerns, and the like. In the case of the NOJ&amp;GNRR such as search led to “A Strategic Railroad: The New Orleans, Jackson and Great Northern in the Civil War” <em>Louisiana History</em>, 11:2 (Spring 1973) by Lawrence F. Estaville. Our search (in World Cat) also led to a special assemblage of source materials at the University of Texas, Austin: the Natchez Trace Railroad Collection that contains a rare map of the railroad “and its connections” dated 1856. Another “find” using the same finding aid was an on-line copy of the railroad’s <em>Annual Report</em>, dated January 1866, available through the New Orleans Public Library.</p>
<p>Sometimes one gets lucky. While researching this particular map we developed a habit of looking for our New Orleans railroad in the index of any book we picked up. Wow! There it was on page 117 of the <em>Historical Atlas of the North American Railroad</em> (2010) by Derek Hayes, featuring a map with the very same title as the one in Texas, but assigned a later date of about 1873. So, as you continue searching, more questions present themselves and new leads to follow keep appearing. Research never ends. Its root meaning is “to search again.” See the “Going Further” section of the module on “Railroad Maps, 1876-Present” for some additional suggestions.</p>

  return `<p>Henry Varnum Poor’s <em>Manual of the Railroads of the United States for 1874-75</em> (New York 1874), then in its seventh edition and totaling 945 pages, had become the standard source of information on all railroads of the nation. Of the 110 pages devoted to advertisements, only one (22) was for maps. Nevertheless, Asher &amp; Adams, publishers of maps of all kinds, atlases, and travel guides, used a full page to enumerate the various ways in which every railroad needed a map publisher: for company reports, to enhance advertising, to encourage land sales, for submission to state regulatory agencies, for internal uses in the office and in the field, as well as to aid travelers. The New York City firm stood ready to furnish maps “of any portion of the United States and Canada, in styles to suit.” The sheets were ready to use and could be customized by overprinting in gray or in color to eliminate “the cost and delay of engraving the map.” (Poor 1874-1875, 22). Meanwhile, in the Midwest, Rand, McNally and Company had vigorously entered the field of producing railroad maps, encouraging patrons to custom-design each map to show their particular line in the most advantageous fashion and to detract attention from their competitors. The upstart Chicago publisher quickly became the dominant producer of railroad maps, largely as a result of its use of the wax-engraving method of production which greatly reduced the time and costs involved.</p>

<h3>Depression and Recovery</h3>
<p>Maps and railroads continued to march hand in hand far into the next century. But during the mid-1870ʼs the parade of economic progress had stalled in its tracks. The Panic of 1873, precipitated by the collapse of Jay Cooke’s financial empire and centered on the Northern Pacific Railway, hit the nation with a violent suddenness and then led to a long depression lasting to the end of the decade. Henry Varnum Poor, gathering the statistics for the first year of the depression, 1874, had to acknowledge, in the initial sentence of his annual report, that “for the first time since the publication of this <em>Manual</em>…the railroad interests of the country have received a decided check… A full exhibit of their decline is given in the annexed tables.” (Poor 1875-1876, xxvii) Actually, maps would have told the story even better. The number of new miles of track laid in 1874 dropped by a factor of four from the high point in 1871.</p>
<p>Recovery would not come until 1879. “The past year has been an extraordinary one,” <em>Railway Age</em> declared in its final issue of that year (Dec. 25, 1879) because the total annual miles of track laid had once again resumed an upward course. “Annual miles of track laid” had become a prime measure of the nation’s economy, a factor that lent itself to cartographic presentation. But Henry Varnum Poor, conservative by nature, did not use maps in his <em>Manual</em> until 1887 when the American Bank Note Company supplied what amounted to a twenty-page railroad atlas of North America scattered through the volume. The New York engraving firm also did some large printing jobs and became the printer for Poor’s annual compendium. A table of contents for the atlas directed readers to the appropriate page for a clear, colored map arranged by states or provinces. The reverse side of these special atlas pages promoted the American Bank Note Company, connecting railroad maps with advertising. The atlas then became a regular part of Poor’s <em>Manual</em>.</p>
<p>Two years later, <em>Engineering News</em>, which had merged with the <em>American Railway Journal</em> in 1888, provided an attractive fold-out map (No. 9) for Poor’s annual publication, showing the new railway construction in the United States in 1886, 1887, and the beginning of 1889. The color-coded map served to advertise the weekly newspaper as well as its separately published <em>Atlas of Railway Progress</em> which provided the same information in greater detail, aided by a series of five larger-scaled regional maps. Like earlier versions of these useful maps, it featured, in bold red lines, the “track laid since January first of the previous year.” Each section of new track then had a number to refer to the name of the railroad on an accompanying list.</p>
<p>A similar map from <em>Engineering News</em> was inserted into the 1889 edition of Poor’s <em>Manual</em>, but it covered only the Southwestern region of the United States. Very interestingly, however, it showed not new construction, but how the fourteen major lines were divided into three groups based on ownership and financial control. The Gould System of railroads led the way. The following year, in Poor’s <em>Manual</em> for 1890, <em>Engineering News</em> once again presented a fold-out map of North America showing trackage laid in 1886, 1887, 1888, and 1889, number 22 in its series of maps. This sheet, measuring over 13 x 20 inches also served as the general map for an updated <em>Atlas of Railway Progress</em> which, beginning with this edition, began to include system maps of individual lines to accompany the data for these companies, each map probably paid for by its respective railroad company. These system maps presented an opportunity to enhance the presentation of facts and figures in what had become the investors’ bible. The number of such system maps declined in the next edition, but the Rio Grande Western Railway raised the ante with a well-designed map on a two-page spread (Poor 1891, 902-903). Attractive maps had invaded the staid precincts of high finance.</p>

<h3>Popular Maps</h3>
<p>Toward the opposite end of the economic spectrum railroad maps also figured in various expressions of popular culture such as handbills, song sheets, and almanacs. The interest generated by the completion of the transcontinental railroad in 1869 called for a variety of maps in newspapers, periodicals, and advertising circulars. Two of the most interesting examples involved an insurance company’s advertising handbill and a song sheet to entertain passengers on long-distance railroad travel.</p>
<p>The first map presents the route across the Great West as a herald of progress. It features the completed tracks as well as sketches for a more southern line envisioned by the Kansas Pacific Railway. The map appeared on the side of a flier, slightly larger than a dollar bill, presenting the actual and projected railroad routes from St. Louis to California, all enclosed in a fancy, financial-type frame. The verso with an identical border looked like a bank note with the St. Louis Mutual Life Insurance Co. promising to pay ten thousand dollars to “your wife and children” at your passing, “for a small annual premium.” Two labels appeared on the map: one, “From St. Louis to Denver, New Mexico and California” promoted the city; the other urging the bearer “to protect your dependent ones” obviously pointed to the insurance policy, but could also refer to the message conveyed by the map as well. The piece, lithographed by A. Gast &amp; Company, came in multiple versions, one for each of the insurance firm’s state agents. The map perhaps was chosen to provide a boost of optimism for a somber topic. It was, however, a typical railroad map, with the cartographer giving the sponsoring city every advantage, pushing Chicago to the edge of the map, cutting off the rival’s rail links to the east and erasing those to the north, south, and west. The configuration of the railroads on this map suggests a date of 1870, several years before Rand McNally &amp; Company published its first railroad map. Thus the distorting of railroad maps to gain advantage was a well-practiced art in the Midwest before the celebrated Chicago publisher, which perfected the art of favorable treatment, designed its first map.</p>
<p>Indeed, one of the Chicago firm’s earliest maps, “Rand, McNally and Co.sʼ New Railway Guide Map of the United States and Canada,” originally prepared for the May, 1873 edition of the firm’s <em>Railway Guide</em>, was a model of thorough, accurate reporting. One early version also appeared on the reverse side of a song sheet which provided words to about three dozen songs along with a pitch for their <em>Railway Guide</em> “for sale on this train.” Beneath the words to the songs Charles Heck, a Chicago publisher and bookseller, also placed a notice that “this with songs, maps, etc.” would be included in “Heckʼs Prize Packages,” presumably a kit of things needed for a long train trip. The package included the large railroad map of the continent which had inset maps of the nation’s leading cities, the transcontinental route, and a “New Mining Map of Utah.” The song sheet occupied the verso of the large map and, in case one didn’t sing, also furnished household hints and recipes to peruse while passing the time. These features included directions for making goodies from blackberry wine to a wedding cake.</p>
<p>In short, the ubiquity of railroad maps in popular culture during the decades following the Golden Spike provides a noteworthy commentary on America as it entered the last decades of the nineteenth century. Maps of the railroad network, now reaching outward to fill a continental frame, undoubtedly reinforced a national view. Thus when Rand, McNally &amp; Co. produced a “General Map of the Baltimore and Ohio Rail Road and Its Connections” in 1876, it included an inset map to carry the tracks across the wide Missouri, west from Kansas City and Omaha to the Pacific Ocean. Three years later, when A.T. Sears and E. Webster produced their <em>Railway Guide with Popular Routes for summer and Winter Tourists</em> (Chicago, 1879) they pointed to another transcontinental route, this one oriented southward: “The Illinois Central is now the great link in the chain of communication between this country, Mexico, and South America.”</p>
<p>North America’s traditional Golden Gate transcontinental route also became the central focus of maps with a global message such as the Pacific Mail and Steam-Ship Company’s “Chart Showing the Route of the Company’s Australian Mail Service” (Sidney: W. E. Smith, 1880) which traced her majesty’s mails by way of the “overland route to Great Britain” via Auckland, Honolulu, San Francisco, Ogden, Omaha, Chicago, and New York.</p>
<p>The classic visual image of an American railroad map’s transformation into a global document is “The World’s Railroad Scene,” a chromolithograph by Swain &amp; Lewis printed about 1882. The map of North America, with the states and territories appearing in pastel colors, features only the sponsoring road, the Illinois Central. The oversize map is then projected on a globe from which a passenger train bursts through at the lower right corner of the sheet. The brilliant colors of the locomotive highlight its dominant central position in the composition. At the right a crowd gathers at a typical town’s depot. People of all ages wait to board the train, but others seem to just stand and marvel at the wonder coming to a halt right in their community. Insets show a stage coach and canal boat to remind viewers of an age passing away while a steamship, at dock on the left, is only half-way into the age of steam: Its three masts towering over the belching smokestack. The large headlamp mounted on the locomotive and the telegraph wires parallel to the rails remind us that in the modern world railroad routes had conquered time as well as space. The globe, as an earth portrait, seems the proper symbol for an American railroad and it hoists a bold I.C.R.R. beneath the North Pole.</p>
<p>No town is identified by a sign on the plain wooden depot, but the simplicity of its architecture is itself a symbol of American democracy. Everyplace, to amount to something, needed a railroad depot. The simple structure connected the locality to the tracks and thereby to many other communities up and down the line, eventually reaching the ocean and its global shipping traffic. One can be assured that a wall map of the “Illinois Central and Its Connections” hung in this depot; perhaps a world map might have been called for as well.</p>

<h3>Railroad Maps and Development</h3>
<p>Railroads in the period 1870-1900 were the key to economic development. Without tracks, communities would not be connected to the modern world; without a train station they would be left out on the march to progress. To become a progressive town, to take a role in the American pageant, one needed a train in the Age of Steam. And maps opened the door. Take Tacoma in the Washington Territory, for example.</p>
<p>In 1888, following the completion of the Northern Pacific Railroad, with its western terminal at Tacoma, and in anticipation of the Oregon and California Railroad completing its link to the city in 1889, Allen C. Mason, a local booster, published a <em>Compendium of Information Concerning the City of Tacoma</em>. The pamphlet, introduced by a map of the region, was printed in Portland, Oregon, presumably because Tacoma had not yet grown enough to supply cartographic services. Oregon, enjoying the benefits of early rail links, grew in population much sooner than the Puget Sound communities. Now that the railroad had arrived, however, Washington soon multiplied its population fivefold and became a state in 1889. The map in Mason’s pamphlet played up the new railroads, giving them the thickest lines on the map and highlighting the resources in the regions they crossed with bold type, all in caps. “Wheat, Gold, Timber, Iron, Coal,” and so on covered the Washington Territory, but diminished in Oregon and British Columbia. Although the railroads ended in Tacoma, sea lanes continued their lines, each identified by letters and a key: “to Alaska…route from China and Japan, route to Mexico and South America…to Victoria…to San Francisco.” “This city has the market of the world before it,” Mason declared (74) and its “foundation stone” was the Northern Pacific Railroad.</p>
<p>Pamphlets and boosters can be found for almost every town in the nation and maps like Mason’s, pointing to resources and celebrating the railroad, usually accompany them. Many times railroads themselves were the promoters, seeking financing, selling farms or developing towns on their own land, and encouraging the development of resources along their lines in the hope of expanding traffic. The whole idea behind land grants to finance the construction of railroads naturally pushed these companies into real estate promotion following the model developed by the Illinois Central Railroad in the 1850s. In the last decade of the century this line repeated its earlier program by acquiring a half million acres in the Mississippi Delta and encouraging the transformation of wetland forests into cotton fields. Not to be outdone, the Louisville and Nashville Railroad promoted its land holdings in neighboring Alabama by sending an exhibit train to tour the Middle West in 1888. It reported that a million visitors came to see these exhibit cars and took home some 30 million leaflets, many of them featuring maps.</p>
<p>Local communities also turned to maps to help their residents envision what the coming of a railroad could do for them. In Wisconsin, when Grant County promoters realized that their area was underserved by railroads they conceived of a railroad which would make a circle connecting the major towns in the county with a link crossing the next county to reach a major railroad in Illinois just to the south. To show the route they simply overprinted a sectional map of the county (undated) with a red line that looks like a red balloon and labeled it the “Chicago Short Line.” The proposal did not get off the ground, but most of the towns eventually found other ways to “get connected” by rail.</p>
<p>Although the building of new railroads and the opening of new areas to settlement were usually cast in positive terms and their maps pointed to progress, many people and places, especially in the older states and more settled areas raised questions of costs and benefits. The classic cartographic expression of this perspective is a “Map of the United States Exhibiting the Grants of Land Made to…Railroads” published by the Justice Publishing Company of New York under the banner headline: “Map Showing How the People’s Land has been Squandered upon Corporations.” The impression left by the map was that all of the land in the shaded areas was given away, but the broad swaths included the alternate sections of land retained by the government (“the People’s Land”) and the extra bands, called indemnity tracts, which would be available to the railroads only if their sections were already taken up by settlers. The map appeared in a pamphlet, <em>The History of Our Public Lands</em>, issued by the Justice Publishing Company of New York City 1882. This tract advocated reclaiming the lands set aside for the railroads but which had not yet been taken up by them. Championing “the workers of the country,” the pamphlet wanted prospective settlers to obtain these lands for $1.25 per acre under the Homestead Act. Fraud, of course existed on lands granted to homesteaders as well as to railroads and the outcry against “the give-away program” had peaked several years earlier, about 1871, when 20 million acres were set aside for railroad land grants. Indeed, Congress granted almost no land to encourage railroad construction after that date. At the same time the early Granger laws also started government regulation of the railroads. This was over a decade before the Justice Publishing Company’s map appeared. Although the “People’s Land Squandered” map seems to have had only a modest impact at its time, it was given a long and influential career when the Democratic Party had Rand, McNally and Company develop a similar map for the Presidential Election of 1884. Titled “How the Public Domain has been Squandered,” this broadside also included an excerpt from the party’s platform: “We believe that the public lands ought, as far as possible, be kept as homesteads, for actual settlers, [and] that all unearned lands heretofore improvidently granted to railroad corporations by action of the Republican party should be restored.” (Public Lands 1885) In the twentieth century either the 1882 or the 1884 version of this “propaganda” map has often appeared in history textbooks, making it probably the nation’s most well-known railroad map, and, we might add, the least understood.</p>
<p>Even in 1882, when the seminal propaganda piece was apparently first published, it was not new, but reproduced of an 1878 map issued in a report on the arid lands in the Western US by John Wesley Powell. (Hayes 2007, 197) This is not to say that the federal land grants to railroads were beyond criticism. Especially in the case of the transcontinentals, in Canada as well as in the United States, the tracks across the Western reaches of the continent were probably built before they were really needed. Little consideration was given to true costs, economic to be sure, but also environmental, and human, especially in the neglect of Indian and workers’ rights and livelihoods. As it was, deception, waste, fraud, and misuse of resources were all too common in the story of American railroad expansion, all factors that are difficult to portray on maps. Cartography, it seems, has a built-in bias toward optimism. Nowhere is this characteristic shown with more force than in the railroad maps of the late nineteenth century.</p>

<h3>Governmental Maps</h3>
<p>This observation seems to be true even in the maps produced by the state and federal regulatory agencies set up to coordinate, oversee, and regulate America’s railroads. Beginning even before the Granger legislation in the Midwest during the early 1870s, many states had sponsored internal improvement programs that included railroads. These led to various types of public agencies on the state level. The Granger laws, however, created official commissions charged with gathering information, enforcing laws, discussing problems, encouraging solutions, and even projecting future transportation needs. As state governmental agencies, these railroad commissions conceived the trackage within their jurisdiction as a state-wide system. Mapping its territory, as state governments were apt to do, led to a splendid series of railroad maps for almost all states, beginning in the 1870s or 1880s. Issued as state publications and often appended to annual reports, these maps were mostly produced by commercial map publishers under governmental contracts. As up-to-date general state maps they served as educational materials and supported state programs encouraging economic development, immigration, law enforcement, and a variety of other functions. (See <a href="/american-railroad-maps-1873-2012/1916-georgia-railroad#top">Selection 5</a>)</p>
<p>When the Interstate Commerce Commission was established by the federal government in 1887 it was given broad but vague powers combining executive, legislative, and judicial functions. The goal was to establish a panel of experts who would be beyond politics to oversee the nation’s railroads. But the agency developed along a legalistic, case-by-case basis, acting largely in response to public complaints. Producing maps was not seen as part of its mission as was the case with most of the various state railroad commissions. It was not until the twentieth century that the Commission embarked on a systematic mapping program in its attempt to value the capital investment of each railroad as a basis for determining fair shipping rates. (see <a href="/american-railroad-maps-1873-2012/1919-railroad-valuation-map-itasca#top">Selection 6</a>) Mapping railroads on the federal level was left to the topographic and thematic maps produced by the Department of the Interior and the Bureau of the Census.</p>

<h3>Standardization</h3>
<p>After the Civil War, in an attempt to get the collection of individual railroads to function as a system, special private agents worked with the various lines to facilitate individual shipments of goods and materials. The success of these firms, like the Blue Line Fast Freight Co., which owned its own rolling stock, led to freight being “forwarded between the Atlantic and the Pacific without change of cars.” By the late 1870s the service was being utilized by ordinary people for everyday transactions. A waybill dated March 6, 1878, for example, notes that L. C. M. Barnum of West Deerfield, Massachusetts sent via a Blue Line boxcar, “one sewing machine, second hand” to M. Colestes in Chicago. The boxcar travelled over the tracks of three or four different companies to reach its destination. And, if needed, the sewing machine could have continued on to Nebraska or California. The document specified a first class rate of 160 cents per 100 pounds and carried its share of fine print, but it shows how creative people found ways to make a disjointed system work. Did Mr. or Ms. Barnum consult a railroad map before deciding to ship the sewing machine? Probably not, because a Blue Line agent could do it for them, probably using one of the “shippers’ guides” published for their use. The <em>Rand McNally Business Atlas</em> soon dominated this field. (See <a href="/american-railroad-maps-1873-2012/1909-rand-mcnally-business-atlas-florida">Selection 4</a>) Soon a standard gauge, standard time, union stations, uniform operating rules, transfer agreements, and a host of mechanical improvements would ease the flow of traffic. Each step along the way added value to the nation’s transportation system. In the process, the railroad maps, which pictured a uniform, smoothly functioning transportation network, became more aligned with reality.</p>
<p>The push toward the standardization of railroads in the United States was largely the result of private-sector efforts. The standardization of time, which came first, started as individual companies extended the time used in a major city to the surrounding area. Timetables simplified the matter, especially if all stops used the same time. When the telegraph and other devices started to control the movement of trains, a standard time and accurate railroad watches became absolutely necessary. Switching time between zones became cumbersome if not done on an hourly basis. In 1883, a convention of railroad officials meeting in a Chicago hotel agreed to divide the continent into a series of hourly time zones. Henceforth railroad maps needed to mark each of these time zones and include an explanation of this new cartography.</p>
<p>A standard gauge measuring the distance between the two rails came next, signaled by the massive switch of the 5’ broad-gauge tracks in the South to the increasingly standard 4” 8½” English gauge in 1886. Except for the use of narrow gauge trackage in special areas such as mountains, the standard width gradually was adopted by all companies in the decades following the completion of the transcontinental railroad, which followed this width by Congressional mandate. The emphasis on “through trains,” the rise of shipping agencies, the sharing of cars, the lengthening of lines, and the development of systems had encouraged a standard width. In the 1870s, the Blue Line, the shipping agency which carried the Barnum sewing machine, advertised its “great central route” which used agreements with five railroads to forward freight from New York to California. The dimensions of railroad cars, clearances for bridges and tunnels, and similar standards were also worked out privately as practical matters.</p>
<p>The third step in standardization was both a cause and product of the gradual emergence of a national railroad network. This involved the agreement by various companies to abide by uniform operating rules. While technology was making railroad travel safer and more comfortable with improvements in braking trains, heating cars, and providing locomotive power. Uniform operating rules concerning such details as telegraphic abbreviations and uniform systems for using signal lights were needed as cars and even entire trains were shuttled from the operations of one line to another. Again a product of private agreement between the various railroad companies, these rules were approved in 1889.</p>
<p>For example, in 1872 P.T. Barnum wanted to introduce the efficiency of scale into his circus. This meant staging shows at the larger towns on a circuit and bypassing presentations in the smaller, unprofitable villages. If the circus wagons could zip through these places on railroad cars they could avoid the pressures to put on a performance every ten miles or so, the distance the wagons could travel in one day. Loading the first train, however, in Terre Haute, Indiana, took twelve hours because the flatcars used had different heights and some of their braking systems prevented “bridging” wagons from one car to the next. A special train solved the problem. It had thirty cars with uniform dimensions and special connecting platforms so that the wagons could be pushed up a ramp at the end of the train and moved to flat cars down the line. As similar accommodations were made in equipment, procedures, and right-of-way rules, the flow of traffic became more efficient and effective, making the network of tracks indicated on the maps actually function as a system.</p>
<p>Indeed special urban “system maps” for important railroad centers like Chicago became signs of progress in their own right, featuring shared trackage, union depots, transfer railroads, by-pass routes, and belt lines. Standardization, system building, and ideas of progress went hand-in-hand.</p>

<h3>Finance Capitalism and the World the Railroads Made</h3>
<p>All three were, in the ideology of capitalism, encouraged by the corporate form of organization, mergers, and the development of trusts. As titans of finance put together business empires abuses of power, the quest for huge profits, and ruthless behavior muddied the actual story. These aspects of finance capitalism were very difficult to portray on maps. As we have seen, propaganda sheets could label the land grants as “give-aways” and <em>Engineering News</em> could use various colors to distinguish between the various “empires” of the financiers, but, in general, railroad maps stood with the status quo and pointed to progress. It took an informed eye to see through the map to witness battles for corporate control, the diversion of public resources into private gain, the exploitation of patrons and workers, the neglect of environmental concerns, or the opportunity costs involved in any railroad development.</p>
<p>But, as the nineteenth century drew to a close, critics, promoters, and commentators from every perspective acknowledged that railroads had revolutionized the way people lived and moved and had their being. As Nicholas Faith observed, “They made a greater and more immediate impact than any other mechanical or industrial invention before or since.” (Faith 1990, 1) Joseph Nimmo, Jr., an astute observer, pointed out in 1889 that in a single lifetime the construction of the American railroads had created “an amount of wealth more than a hundred fold the entire cost or present value” of the system. Moreover, he pointed out, “the value of the goods annually transported by rail” was estimated to be twenty times the cost of constructing the system. (Nimmo 1889, 3). Meanwhile, Edward Atkinson, an apologist for the industry, pointed to society’s dependence on the rails for the basic necessities of life. Without railroads, starvation would face thousands of Americans. (Atkinson 1885, 292) That very fact of life imbued the railroads with great power.</p>
<p>“The few men who control the great railway lines,” William Mason Grosvenor pointed out in the previous decade, have it in their power to strip away the wealth of the nation. “A change of one twentieth of a mill per one hundred pounds, in the charge of transportation per mile, may take hundreds of millions [of dollars] from the actual value of farms.” (Grosvenor 1873, 193) Thus, more than anything else, the public interest rested on the railroads. Any map reader, toward the end of the nineteenth century, knew that railroads were the key to understanding the interaction between people and the environment in any area of the nation. Indeed the lines tracing the tracks on a map almost had enough power to erase political boundaries. In 1884, Nimmo, then an official in the Bureau of Statistics, noted in his <em>Annual Report on the Internal Commerce of the United States</em> that “under our laws, treaty stipulations, and usages, the principal railroads of Canada are practically constituent members of the railroad system of the United States.” (Nimmo 1884, 5) (See Selections <a href="/american-railroad-maps-1873-2012/1886-canadian-pacific#top">2</a>, <a href="/american-railroad-maps-1873-2012/1890-lake-superior#top">3</a> and <a href="/american-railroad-maps-1873-2012/1945-railroad-operations-map-industrial#top">9</a>)</p>

<h3>Interurban Railroads</h3>
<p>At the very time that the Barnum family used the Blue Line to send their used sewing machine from Massachusetts to Illinois, fellow citizens of the Bay State were trying to get a railroad to come to their town. Years of effort produced nothing. “Although surrounded with railroads…a short distance [away, Shrewsbury]…had not one inch of railroad within its borders.” The five and a half miles to the nearest railroad proved to be too hilly for a steam engine. Even an old-fashioned horse railroad would need several teams to reach “the ample Worchester market at their doors.” In 1890, however, a local committee reported that the town had “not waited in vain” because electricity had come to the rescue. “The electric cars are propelled up hill and down with the greatest speed and facility, at small cost, and under perfect control.” <em>The Town of Shrewsbury</em> by the Railroad Committee, 1890, 15, 17). Soon electric railway systems would be springing up across the country, using over-head wires and a trolley to power a new type of railroad. These lines were soon called “interurbans,” or “between cities” railroads.</p>
<p>In 1890 the electrification of street railroads in cities and large towns had become the standard format for a modern metropolitan transit system. Several hundred electric streetcar networks were then operating cities in the United States. The next year the two urban systems in Minneapolis and St. Paul were connected to each other to form a larger interurban system. Why not keep the trolleys expanding beyond the suburbs and outward to the next town? In 1893 the extension of the Portland, Oregon trolley to Oregon City, fifteen miles away, proved to be a great success. By 1900 1,500 miles of interurban tracks reached out from cities and towns throughout the nation. In 1918, when the interurbans reached their greatest extent, over 15,000 miles of track were in service, traversed by over 10,000 trolley cars. Then the First World War curtailed the expansion and the focus in transportation policy shifted to the highways. Indeed, automobiles, trucks, and buses took command with such speed that interurban trains were soon neglected, bankrupt, and forgotten, except for the maps and memories they left behind.</p>
<p>Any metropolitan map in America produced between 1900 and 1930 that omitted the city’s interurban connections had serious shortcomings. In some states, especially in the Midwest, the interurban network developed into state-wide systems. Among the largest of these, the Illinois Traction System, sent its 550 miles of tracks into every part of the state, but failed to develop effective connections with Chicago’s interurban network. Indiana residents were better served in reaching the Windy City, and the Chicago, South Shore, and South Bend remains today as the last interurban railroad.</p>
<p>The <em>Atlas of Traffic Maps</em> issued in 1925 included a map of the interurban lines belonging to the Central Electric Traffic Association based in Indianapolis. (See <a href="/american-railroad-maps-1873-2012/1925-atlas-of-traffic-maps#top">Selection 8</a>) Note the extensive area covered by these lines and that the map showed freight routes rather than passenger service. Similar maps were available for passenger travel, but these were often designed on a state format such as the Indiana Traction System map of 1936 issued by the Indiana Railroad System, a private corporation.</p>
<p>Cartographically, the interurban routes often did not mix with the steam railroads. Usually the interurban maps included the heavy rail lines only when it was to their advantage to show connecting routes and often the difference in locomotion was not indicated. In other examples the interurban maps omitted the steam lines altogether. Even general reference maps seem to have regarded the interurbans as a separate system, local in interest, perhaps ephemeral in nature, and not worthy of systematic inclusion. The timetables issued by the electric railroads, which often included maps, were similar to those published by the traditional railroads, but usually simpler in design and less expensive to produce. The interurbans relied more heavily on regular commuters from the suburbs or periodic trips from small towns to larger centers for shopping or visiting purposes. The schedule in these cases was much more important than a map of the route.</p>
<p>Some interurban maps and atlases, however, did promote day trips to local places of amusement and recreation. Newspapers like the <em>Brooklyn Eagle</em> issued an annual atlas promoting longer vacations via inexpensive interurban service. Indeed the advantages of electrification led several promoters to urge the construction of long distance electric railroads. The proposed Chicago-New York Electric Air Line would use a third rail instead of a trolley: “No curves…Greater Speed; Perfect Safety. Time and Money Saved,” its prospectus trumpeted. The accompanying map pictured the route as a straight line through Toledo and Cleveland, emphasizing a saving of 230 miles over the New York Central Route. Although, as the sheet proclaimed, “20 million people [were] waiting to patronize this road [and travel from] New York to Chicago in 10 hours,” the line never reached either city, constructing only twenty-five miles of track in Indiana. (Modelski 1984, 95) The promise of electrification, however, did lead the Milwaukee Road to use current in crossing the mountains when it constructed its transcontinental line between 1905 and 1915. (See <a href="/american-railroad-maps-1873-2012/1920-milwaukee-road">Selection 7</a>)</p>
<p>Although interurbans continued to be built into the 1920s, other lines were abandoned as the upwardly-mobile increasingly moved to more distant suburbs or came to favor private automobiles over public transit. Steam railroads faced the same competition, reaching their peak mileage in 1916. Most interurbans were uncoincidentally built at the time (1900-1915) that steam railroads found it difficult to attract new capital. As rising costs of labor, coal, and taxes, plus increasing government regulation, cut into profits, the traditional railroads were often forced to mortgage their properties to modernize their operations. A firm in New York City even issued <em>Kimber’s Atlas of Railroad Maps describing and illustrating the Security for Every Mortgage Bond of the Steam Railroads of the United States</em> (1920-1923).</p>

<h3>Railroads in Wartime</h3>
<p>Bankruptcies faced many lines in the early twentieth century. Thus when the First World War increased the demand for transportation, US railroads were not ready. Rolling stock was in short supply and so many loaded freight cars clogged Eastern port cities in December 1917 that the federal government took over the lines, intending to run the rail network as a single system during the emergency. Antitrust legislation in the previous decades had worked against such integration, but some national leaders such as William Jennings Bryan had urged federal ownership of the railroads as an alternative to regulation. When the government took over the railroads, it quickly ordered 100,000 new boxcars and 2,000 locomotives, eliminated redundant tracks as well as duplicate routes, and streamlined operations to facilitate the movement of goods and troops to Atlantic and Gulf ports.</p>
<p>However, as the war ended, public opinion urged that the railroads be returned to private ownership as soon as possible. On the other hand, the efficiencies gained by coordination and new investments were obvious. The Esch-Cummins Transportation Act of 1920, in effect, gave the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) the power to continue shaping the railroads into a coordinated national system. It even specified that the agency must develop a plan to group the individual lines into a series of coordinated regional segments. The result, the Ripley Plan developed by a Harvard Professor (See Selection 8), was constantly amended and revised until the onset of the Great Depression made it obsolete. Then, when President Franklin Delano Roosevelt started to address the nation’s economic woes in 1933, he turned to a Wall Street leader to formulate a new national railroad plan. F.H. Prince relied on a knowledgeable railroad leader for new maps. John W. Barriger III, head of the Railroad Division of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation divided the nation’s trackage into three regions (North, South, and West) and eight operating systems. But the plan was dead upon arrival at the White House because it would result in many lost jobs. As President Roosevelt read the map, America in the Great Depression needed more, not fewer jobs. Thus the national railroad system portrayed on the maps continued to fall far short of its potential.</p>
<p>The railroads themselves objected to reductions in competition in large measure because during the 1920s prosperity seemed to be returning to their companies. Abandoning excess trackage, using heavier rails, expanding block signals to keep “blocks” of track section apart and thus lessen the likelihood of accidents, and espousing Centralized Traffic Control to reduce congestion, among other advances, led to efficiency gains which in turn attracted renewed capital investment.</p>
<p>Thus when the Second World War broke out, the nation’s railroad network was up to the wartime challenges. (See <a href="/american-railroad-maps-1873-2012/1945-railroad-operations-map-industrial#top">Selection 9</a>) The Office of Defense Transportation played a coordinating rather than an operating role. Mobilizing the nation’s resources provided many opportunities to demonstrate the advantages of scientific management and the professional leadership of the Association of American Railroads in this respect paid handsome dividends. The end result, in railroad terms, was a convincing demonstration of the value of the nation’s railroads to the nation’s defense and the country’s economic health. Few maps of any kind had the patriotic theme and widespread impact of those provided by the various lines to help soldiers and sailors move easily across the country. One gets the impression that service men and women often asked for two copies, one for their own use in transit and one so the folks back home could follow their journeys on a map.</p>

<h3>Tourist Maps</h3>
<p>The railroad maps addressed to service personnel were a popular version of the more elaborate travel literature produced by the railroads in the early decades of the twentieth century. These advertisements, timetables, travel guides, promotional booklets, posters, and promotional materials of every description often featured maps. Many of these folded out to present the particular line and its territory in an appealing, colorful design. Most followed established cartographic conventions for railroad maps. (See Selections <a href="/american-railroad-maps-1873-2012/1870-white-mountains#top">1</a> &amp; <a href="/american-railroad-maps-1873-2012/1890-lake-superior#top">3</a>) For example, a map showing the “Washington-Sunset Route to the East” issued by the Southern Railway, the Southern Pacific Company, and their partners in 1912 stretched the national map in east-west fashion to provide space for dozens of stations along the route from San Francisco through El Paso, New Orleans, and Atlanta to Washington, DC, with an extension to Philadelphia, New York, and Boston. The mainline, boldly stated on the map, traced a gentle arc, seeming to put half of the country within easy reach of its service.</p>
<p>Another example, the Wabash Railway’s travel brochure titled “A Vacation for Everybody” (1917), used a simple outline map for each offering, buttressed by a system map to show how the company’s tracks collected vacationers from the Midwest to send them on to favored destinations in the North and East.</p>
<p>In the 1920s the Santa Fe Railway provided patrons with free postcards which featured large red circles on a system map to show all of its celebrated Harvey House Hotels and Dining Stations. The traveler was urged to mark the place and date the card to show where “I am…today.” Other lines also tapped the post card mania of the early twentieth century to show off their trains, map their routes, and picture the fabulous sights along the way.</p>
<p>Railroad maps seemed to seize every new opportunity in popular print culture to advertise particular companies, from wall calendars and postcards to playing cards and comic books. One of the most striking examples updated the Illinois Central globe discussed earlier, “The World’s Railroad Scene.” The Charles I. Felthousen Company of Chicago, a producer of educational posters, recreated the image in 1910 using modern details: A motor truck and automobile in the foreground, an ornate depot in place of the former plain building, aircraft of various types in the sky, and a streetcar and steamship on the left. The simple US map on the globe named states, capitals, major cities, and rivers. Designed for geographic instruction, E.S. Yates, the artist, centered the viewer’s attention on the great agent of modern progress: The steam locomotive.</p>
<p>Railroads in the 1930s continued to sound the themes of progress. The Chicago Burlington and Quincy Railroad introduced its Zephyrs in 1934, the first of the streamlined passenger trains. These diesel-electric trains with storied names quickly racked up records for speed in their triumph over time. Railroads also seemed to have conquered space several decades earlier when Henry M. Flagler completed the spectacular extension of his Florida East Coast Railway to Key West. Using over eighty bridges and viaducts, the rails reached out almost a hundred miles into the sea to reach the southern-most point in the United States. But, the year after the Burlington’s Zephyrs appeared, a hurricane destroyed a long section of the Key West track. And then, adding insult to injury, when the route was rebuilt in 1938, it was as a highway rather than a railroad.</p>

<h3>Decline</h3>
<p>Key West inherited a landmark train station, but was left without rail service. This was a token of things to come. World War II perhaps delayed the day of reckoning, but the shift in national priorities to the construction of highways and pipelines as well as facilities for inland waterways and air travel, already notable before 1941, became more and more pronounced after 1945. In the year that the war ended, railroads carried 60% of the nation’s freight, measured by ton-miles. By 1980 that figure had dropped to 35%. In 1945 railroads dominated inter-city travel, twenty-five years later, travel by rail had almost disappeared. It would be saved only by Amtrak which started operations in 1971. (See <a href="/american-railroad-maps-1873-2012/1971-amtrak-passenger#top">Selection 10</a>)</p>
<p>In these decades of decline, railroad motive power shifted almost completely from steam engines to diesel-electric motors. Streamliners introduced the new technology but it was in freight service that companies reaped the major benefits. Diesel-powered freight trains started in 1941 and, after delays spurred by war-time restrictions; they almost completely replaced steam locomotives by 1960.</p>
<p>The 1950s also witnessed the emergence of a new approach to freight transportation: the transshipment container that could be easily moved as a unit from boat to train to truck. These intermodal links surely intensified the way informed people would read a railroad map. Connecting points for rail, truck, steamship, inland water, and air transport became critical points in sustaining global commerce and modern life. Now terminal facilities attracted attention. In 1959 when the Pullman-Standard Car Manufacturing Company offered readers of <em>Railway Age</em> (January 19, 69) a print of a railroad painting, “suitable for framing,” it featured a new Louisville and Nashville assembly yard in Birmingham, Alabama rather than a train curving around a mountain bend or a map showing the extent of railroad coverage. The typical railroad office such as the one pictured in the March 30 issue of that year featured a system map behind the executive’s desk.</p>
<p>In the 1950s railroad maps were not what they used to be. Railroad cartography, especially when addressed to the general public increasingly looked like stick charts with straight lines connecting major cities in the fashion of air line maps (see the following maps in <em>Railway Age</em> for 1959: March 30, p. 24; April 27, p. 64; and May 18, p. 6). Moreover, many former types of railroad maps no longer had a function. The land promotion maps introduced in the 1850s were now obsolete. The Illinois Central still had a large development department, but its focus had shifted to industrial sites, urban projects, and the promotion of scientific agriculture and forestry. Even the system maps that had hung in depots and served as centerfolds in timetables started to disappear as passenger service declined.</p>
<p>Several thousand individual trains were eliminated in the 1950s and the Transportation Act of 1958 made it easier for railroads to abandon passenger routes altogether. With the development of the Interstate Highway System, its road maps became the primary reference tool for American geography. By 1971 when it looked like intercity railroad passenger service would completely disappear, Congress created Amtrak to salvage at least the ghost of a system. Then there was only a single railroad passenger map in the country, and it looked forlorn. (See <a href="/american-railroad-maps-1873-2012/1971-amtrak-passenger#top">Selection 10</a>)</p>
<p>For freight service railroad maps still found a use when addressing the general public. One interesting experiment tried to adapt the “piggy-back” service used by various railroads to haul trailers for motor trucks on flatbed cars, following the example of the old circus trains. In 1971 the Auto-Train Corporation started offering piggy-back service for people and their automobiles between Washington, D.C. and Orlando, Florida. Passenger service on this train recalled the golden age of railroad travel: Private sleeping compartments, domed observation cars, first-run movies, and even entertainers posing as Disney characters. After a decade the private venture failed when it tried to expand operations to other cities. Container shipping and unit trains, however, sparked a revival of interest in railroads by the investment community and their focus shifted to the consolidation of North America’s railroads into a handful of large systems. Thus, some lines, like the Norfolk Southern, continued to issue system maps for the use of shippers.</p>

<h3>Maps for Consolidation</h3>
<p>Maps, whether on paper or in the mind, have always undergirded the thousands of mergers and acquisitions that forged longer routes and transportation systems out of the original short lines. The Southern Railway System’s advertisement in <em>Railway Age</em> (March 30, 1959 pp. 18-19) boasted “Man Power, Map Power, you get both…” by way of its services. “Just look at the map and you’ll see what we mean.” In this case acquisitions fashioned a network so shippers “could <em>often</em> ʻdo it all with a one system haul.ʼ” The merger of the rival Pennsylvania and New York Central lines in 1966 was possibly the most celebrated merger after 1960 when the consolidation envisioned by industry experts in the 1920s and 1930s finally took root. It was not successful, but the idea behind it provided a key to the future. Each of these business combinations needed regulatory approval and the support of Wall Street. The literature generated by this process often included advocacy maps.</p>
<p>Donald J. Russell, President of the Southern Pacific Company, provided an early example of such maps in 1960 when he prepared a map to accompany “An Open Letter to Shippers, Communities, and the General Public” on “Why Southern Pacific’s Proposal Best Serves the Public Interest.” The issue at hand was which company should acquire the Western Pacific Railroad, Mr. Russell’s line or the Santa Fe Railway? “The map shows why only Southern Pacific and Western Pacific can co-ordinate their operations to produce major public benefits,” Russell’s letter insisted. The map emphasized how the two lines were geographically intertwined, running “virtually side by side” and thus in the best position “to compete for traffic” with “other modes of transportation.” Carefully reading the map in the context of the letter and the accompany notes provides many insights into the course of railroad history over the next half century, ending with the consolidation of North American railroads into six first class rail systems. In the process both the Southern Pacific and the Western Pacific would eventually become part of the Union Pacific Railroad. Moreover, the US-Canadian boundary would be crisscrossed by international railroad companies as envisioned by experts over a century earlier.</p>

<h3>Prospects for Century 21</h3>
<p>Most of the maps showing the possibilities of high-speed passenger rail routes look like air line charts rather than railroad maps, often eliminating the cross-ties and reducing the right-of-way to a straight line. The tragedy of 9-11 in 2001, along with other factors, revived some public support for railroad passenger service, and an advertising campaign by Amtrak in 2011 introduced a new type of railroad map. In these examples, the map traced the thoughts of a passenger in route as a line gently curved across the page from “Point A” on the left to “Point Be” on the right. In one magazine advertisement a college student starts out with a segment labeled “Crank out five pages of thesis” before observing “a roadrunner” and “snapping rolls of film,” somewhat anachronistically. (<em>Midwest Living</em>, September 2011) Another version, this one for newspapers, showed stations along the way: “Relax, Read, Nap, Chat, Dinner, and Stars.” The punchline in each case was: “Be transported in more ways than one.”</p>
<p>The same adage, of course, applies to railroad maps. There is more than one way to read them. Old maps document the geographies of the past, but they also point to states of mind. They collect a host of data and, in the process, reveal larger forces at work. One needs some context to sense the layers of meaning in any map, but the intricate interaction between railroads and their maps seems to illuminate especially well the paths to cartographic literacy.</p>
<p>“In terms of its ability to haul goods or people, the diesel-electric locomotive is, so far, the most fuel-efficient form of self-powered land transportation ever devised” the editor of <em>Railway Age</em> declared in March 2010 (28). As such, railroads have an important future as well as a storied past. Maps have served them well in the past and promise continuing utility in the future. But we must keep in mind the old adage that the map is not the territory. It must be read critically and in context.</p>

<h3>Further Reading</h3>
<p>Among the special characteristics of maps is their ability to push readers into further searching and investigation. Something strikes us about a particular example and we would like to know more about it. The problem is that our quest starts out vague and confused, without a specific question in mind or even a general direction to arrange our thoughts. Maybe before jumping immediately into a search for context and understanding we might profit by reflecting on what it is about this map that attracts us. First read the “Further Reading” section of the unit on “American Railroad Maps, 1828-1876.” Then, if so inclined look at the focus maps in this unit and note our following responses to the question each one raised for us: “What particularly interests us about this map?” Our Responses:</p>
<ol><li><p>Through the White Mountains, (1880). Reading a topographic map is always a challenge because a reader must start with the lay of the land. In this case the mountains create barriers, dividing the land into a series of valley. How will the railroad get through them, reaching to Portland on one end and to Ogdensburg on the other? How does the topography influence the route?</p></li>
<li><p>“The movement of Troops to quell the North West Trouble,” (1885). Upon first glance this seems like an ordinary map, but when we read its title, our interest in stimulated. What does this map mean? Although the cartography seems like an ordinary railroad map, the title spells out something extraordinary, pushing readers to find out more about it.</p></li>
<li><p>The Duluth, South Shore, &amp; Atlantic Railway (1890). This is obviously a tourist map designed to stimulate passenger traffic. Its design and use of color attract our attention. Why is this piece so effective in its graphic design? How does “the look of the map” help it achieve its purpose?</p></li>
<li><p>A Business Atlas Map of Florida, 1909. How would one design a special atlas addressed to business concerns, especially people interested in sending goods or services from one place to another in the United States? In shaping an answer be sure to consider such elements as accuracy, providing all the necessary information, clarity, and the need for frequent revision.</p></li>
<li><p>Railroad Map of Georgia, 1916. Many states issued a railroad map each year. These became precursors of state highway maps which started about the time this map appeared. Both types of transportation maps also served other purposes. Who would use a railroad map? Why did they want to use a map that covered only one state?</p></li>
<li><p>Railroad Valuation Maps, 1919. Large-scale maps provided useful aids in totaling the value of a company’s physical assets. This was important in setting the rates they could charge. Like track charts, these maps often included other features along the right-of-way such as private buildings, roads, and parks. Use this sheet to reconstruct the past geography of Itasca.</p></li>
<li><p>A Time-Table Map, 1920. Passenger railroads in the United States from the very beginning published time tables in newspapers and on handbills or posters. Eventually they included a map of the route or the system along with the schedules. What value was added by including a map? What features on the map would appeal to readers?</p></li>
<li><p>A Railway Traffic Map, 1925. Traffic maps addressed people concerned with the operation of a railroad, especially students learning about freight rates and territories. How do they differ from railroad maps created for the general public?</p></li>
<li><p>A Track Chart: Kansas City, 1945. Large-scale track charts such as this one help us understand railroad operations. This example shows a key transportation node involving several railroads in a dense urban setting. Use it to compare with the small town in focus map 6.</p></li>
<li><p>Creating a National Railroad Network, 1971. When planners envisioned the national passenger railroad network that eventually became Amtrak, the goal was to cross each state with both a north-south and an east-west route. This ideal soon became impractical. The final choice for the initial network is shown here. Check it out for limitations and suggest possible changes.</p></li></ol>

  return `<p>From the 1790s forward, the United States Government’s role in mapping movement extended across several areas of life, including reconnaissance and exploration, internal improvements and infrastructure, national defense, and overseas expansion. Yet this wide-ranging activity was by no means coordinated or well-funded, particularly in the early decades of US history. Instead, the population largely avoided large public works, while state and federal commitments were weak and often driven by local interests. By extension, early governmental mapping of infrastructure and movement was usually the result of individual efforts and particular alignments rather than any larger vision. By the twentieth century this ad hoc approach had been replaced with one that was more regular, permanent, and systematic.</p>
<p>Each of the maps discussed here represents an instance when governing agencies responded to the need to protect citizens, advance national power, or foster commerce. They graphically illustrate techniques used to confront human and natural threats including unpredictable rivers, a vast and seemingly insurmountable West, and wartime enemies. They also suggest a close relationship between governing bureaucracies and private interests, such as railroad and canal companies. The maps are organized into two broad (though overlapping) categories below: Maps for reconnaissance and exploration, and maps for infrastructure and development.</p>

<h3>Maps for National Reconnaissance and Exploration</h3>
<p>President Thomas Jefferson’s decision to seek a transcontinental passage had important consequences for geographic knowledge of the interior. Between 1803 and 1806, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark conducted an expedition from St. Louis to the mouth of the Columbia River and back, the first federally-sponsored scientific expedition of the territory west of the Mississippi River. Lewis and Clark may not have discovered a northwest passage to the Pacific Ocean but they utterly transformed contemporary knowledge of the flora, fauna, topography, Native life, and geography of the West, all of which was part of Jefferson’s original vision for the expedition.</p>
<p>William Clark’s “<a href="/state-and-federal/1803-lewis-clark#top">A Map of Lewis and Clark’s Track</a>” (1811) outlines the extensive and complex mountain range and river systems that had been so poorly understood before the expedition. This is a reduced copy of the original map drawn by William Clark himself, in 1810-1811. Its purpose and origin remain somewhat mysterious, but it may have been designed to guide Samuel Lewis as he engraved the printed version of the map published in 1814. The map traces the entire drainage system of the Missouri, Columbia, Snake, and Clearwater Rivers. The map also reflects Lewis and Clark’s extensive exploration of the Rocky Mountains. In profiling the entire drainage basin of the Missouri River and topography of the Rocky Mountain Range, the map ended the persistent belief of a brief portage between the headwaters of the Columbia and Missouri Rivers. This hope was based in part on Jefferson’s own assumption that rivers remained large even close to their sources, while Clark’s map documents the opposite (Allen 2002). Clark’s track map is somewhat less accurate in the southern reaches of the Rockies, which were well beyond the reach of the expedition. He used the best available knowledge of the time to render these areas, showing the headwaters of the Platte River very near to the Grande and Yellowstone Rivers. He also drew extensively from other sources when mapping the area beyond his expedition with Lewis, including the maps and explorations of Zebulon Pike, and Clark’s own experience as Superintendent of Indian Affairs in St. Louis (Cohen 2002, 91-2). Much of this reconnaissance work depended upon maps that were compiled from Native American sources, though these contributions were rarely recognized or acknowledged.</p>
<p>The published map of the Lewis and Clark expedition remained authoritative until the 1840s, when the explorations of John C. Fremont, Charles Wilkes, and others improved geographical knowledge of the region. Before he led the Bear Flag Rebellion in California in 1846-7, and became the Republican Party’s first candidate for President in 1856, Fremont undertook several dramatic expeditions through the west in the early 1840s. In 1842, aided by an able though reluctant Prussian cartographer named Charles Preuss, Fremont left the Missouri River for a contested part of the Pacific Northwest that Americans called the Oregon Country, but which was known to British interests, who also claimed it, as the Columbia District of the Hudson’s Bay Company. A second expedition departed in June 1843, this time joined by William Gilpin, who was so taken with the Interior West that he spent the next several decades celebrating its commercial potential. The overland migration to Oregon Country grew substantially that same year, as did the increasingly vocal support for the annexation of Texas. Perhaps encouraged by this culture of westward expansionism, Missouri Senator Thomas Hart Benton began to demand that the United States press Great Britain not just on the Oregon question but also a more favorable boundary with British Canada. The Republic, it seemed, was bursting westward.</p>
<p>By 1844, Democrat James Polk campaigned for the presidency on a platform to annex more land in the American northwest, while thousands continued to make the overland trek to Oregon country. This migration gave Fremont’s reports and Preuss’s maps special relevance, for they brought new precision to western geographical knowledge. Preuss’s detailed 1845 “Map of an Exploring Expedition to the Rocky Mountains,” for instance, was one of the first to be drawn entirely from firsthand knowledge of those on the expedition. The map also influenced Mormon history. As historian Richard Francaviglia notes, members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints were desperate to find a religious homeland apart from American persecution. As such, when they ventured west out of Illinois, they were particularly drawn to the blank spots on Preuss’s map, far from Oregon and California. Ironically, while the Mormons were migrating <em>out</em> of the United States to the hopeful land they named Deseret, US settlers in Oregon Country began to petition Congress to <em>extend</em> federal jurisdiction into the Pacific Northwest, as President Tyler had just done in Texas.</p>
<p>All this attention to the West led the historian Bernard DeVoto to dub 1846 “the year of decision.” Fremont, Preuss, and Gilpin did much to fuel this attention. In January, Gilpin wrote a long letter to Missouri Senator David Atchison arguing that an overland mail route to the Pacific Northwest would launch a new era of American commerce in Asia by establishing the first US port on the Pacific coast. Atchison shared Gilpin’s letter, thereby stimulating interest in such a project. In response, the Senate began investigating a continental mail system, both overland but also through Panama and up the West Coast to Oregon Country. Later that year, Gilpin was asked to provide more information on the area based on his experience with Fremont’s second expedition. His report to the Senate circulated widely in the capitol and in newspapers across the country.</p>
<p>That same year, the Senate asked Fremont to create a map of the Oregon Trail, a wagon road that stretched west to Oregon Country from the Missouri River Valley. This map would show more detail than Fremont’s previous efforts and would focus on the overland migrant routes. Though Fremont was away on his third expedition at the time, Preuss earnestly took up the task of compiling the first large-scale <a href="/state-and-federal/1846-fremont-oregon#top">map of the Oregon Trail</a>. The result was an extraordinary seven-sheet map designed such that the angle of the road formed the axis of that particular sheet, each of which covered about 250 miles. Anyone who has struggled with a folding map while driving can appreciate Preuss’s sensible design (Wheat 1959, v.3, n.523, pp. 25-30; Karnes 1970, Ch.5; Cohen 2002). As Preuss was compiling his maps of the overland trail in April, the US entered into war with Mexico after a border skirmish in the newly annexed State of Texas. By June, the US signed a treaty with British authorities that established a northern border of its jurisdiction in the area, and by 1848 Congress had organized the Oregon Territory. Senator Atchison, who had publicized Gilpin’s proposed overland route to the Pacific Northwest, was so impressed by Preuss’s seven-sheet map that he requested 10,000 copies for the Senate. This nicely captures the way that individual projects to map movement often grew out of particular relationships and patronage rather than from any larger comprehensive vision of development.</p>
<p>If Fremont and Preuss substantially expanded Federal knowledge of western geography in the 1840s, they were aided greatly by the simultaneous coastal reconnaissance, chiefly the US Exploring Expedition. This was headed by Charles Wilkes, who had been instructed to survey the Oregon Territory and Columbia River as well as the coast of California and in particular the Bay of San Francisco. Wilkes arrived off the coast of Oregon in 1841 to conduct extensive surveys from the Strait of Juan de Fuca to Puget Sound and east across the Cascade Mountains to the Columbia River Valley. This four-year expedition yielded detailed knowledge of the complex coast and waterways of what would become California and Oregon, neither of which were US territory at the time.</p>
<p>Wilkes’s final report included nautical charts, topographic maps, and thematic maps. The most important of these was the “<a href="/state-and-federal/1841-us-expeditionary-oregon#top">Mouth of the Columbia River, Oregon Territory</a>” (drawn 1841, published 1844). The map was magnificently detailed, and issued just as the United States was beginning to engage Great Britain over control of the region. Moreover, the map of Oregon and the Columbia River also had implications for geographical knowledge elsewhere. Most importantly, Fremont had used the Columbia River survey to prepare his master map of 1845 of the Trans-Mississippi West. Reciprocally, Fremont’s expedition and map of 1843 had also influenced Wilkes’s “Map of the Oregon Territory,” the most comprehensive map of the Northwest to that point, and one that revealed a new picture of the northwest to Americans. Wilkes’s final report of the expedition made a strong case for the US expansion into the Pacific Northwest. He advised an immediate takeover of the Oregon Country to deflect British influence in the region, though in 1844 the attention of many in Washington DC was focused on Texas. Ongoing US emigration to the Northwest forced the issue, however, and by June 1846 the republic successfully established an Oregon Territory with a northern border at the 49th Parallel (Viola and Margolis 1985, 160, 170-171, 180, 223; Wheat 1858, v.2 n.457 and pp. 177-179).</p>
<p>Although the maps of the Exploring Expedition were important when first issued, soon they were supplanted by more detailed surveys undertaken by the US Coast Survey (Stanton 1975), the most important federal scientific agencies prior to the Civil War. Under the direction of Alexander Dallas Bache, the Survey produced thousands of charts and maps of coastlines and rivers, and in the process raised the standard for accuracy in chartmaking. Throughout the 1850s, Bache lured exceptional talent to the Survey, including skilled German immigrants with valuable cartographic experience who had fled the failed revolutions of 1848. Yet even with this formidable strength, Bache faced reluctant support from Congress. Indeed the cartographic output of the Coast Survey in the 1850s says as much about Bache’s ability to procure funding as it does about any systematic federal commitment to surveying the nation’s coasts and waterways.</p>
<p>This calculus shifted substantially when the sectional crisis of the 1850s led to war after the election of President Abraham Lincoln in 1860. Coast Surveyors became invaluable to the Union war effort against the Confederacy. One example of this is the work of the Blockade Strategy Board, a secret Union effort in the summer of 1861 to mount a successful blockade of Confederate-controlled ports and trade. Bache brought tremendous knowledge of the southern coastline to the Board, which enabled it to produce a series of five volumes distributed in July and August. Each of these “memoirs” (as they were known) focused on a particular stretch of Confederate-controlled coast, from Virginia in the northeast to Texas in the far southwest. The reports included not just detailed geographic information, but also valuable data gleaned from prewar reconnaissance to aid naval blockade squadrons. During the war Union officers often cited the Coast Survey maps and charts as the most valuable cartographic intelligence available, both of coastlines and the interior. These efforts to facilitate movement during the war included maps designed for Commanding General George McClellan’s invasion of the Virginia Peninsula in 1862, or those of the Mississippi River designed for his successor, General John Pope, that same year.</p>
<p>While the federal government was using maps to defeat the rebellion in the American south, it was also creating maps to control Native people in the Trans-Mississippi West. Consider the <a href="/state-and-federal/1866-union-pacific-rr#top">map of the Great Plains</a> made under the supervision of Grenville Dodge as he worked to establish the route of the transcontinental railroad. The map was made just as Dodge left his post as Commander of the Plains to become the Chief Engineer of the Union Pacific Railroad. His position in these two positions underscores the close relationship between the military and railroad development: indeed, the former made the latter possible. Dodge’s map was designed to both explore possible routes over the Rockies and—more urgently—to pacify local Indian populations. In this way his map reveals the ways that western exploration both advanced infrastructure and subjugated Native peoples. Moreover, it captures the fundamental conflict between American expansion and the integrity of Indian claims to lands in the American West.</p>
<p>The tenuous relationship between Native Americans, territorial settlers, and the federal government deteriorated further during the 1860s, prompting calls for reform of Indian policy. With the advent of the reservation system, Commissioner of Indian Affairs Nathaniel Taylor commissioned a map of the western territories that focused on the Native American life, compiled from existing public surveys as well as mining and railroad maps. W.J. Keeler’s “National Map of the Territory of the United States” (1868) became the government’s first attempt to map the locations of Indian reservations across the West, though it reflects the contemporary enthusiasm for mineral resources more than anything else. The “Indian troubles” became but a footnote in the larger story of the “hidden treasures” that awaited Anglo-American development and exploitation. Just a few years later, Census Superintendent Francis Amasa Walker, who also succeeded Taylor as Commissioner of Indian Affairs, issued his “Map of Indian Population in the Western United States” (1874), which identified newly-organized reservations and hunting grounds as well as the creeping encroachment of white settlement. In his map and accompanying report, reservations were rendered as both practical and peaceful alternatives to the Indian Wars of the time (Walker 1874).</p>
<p>This flurry of activity related to reconnaissance and exploration, however, does not add up to a systematic program sponsored by the state or federal government. That would change in the twentieth century, once federal sponsorship of surveying became more established and assumed (Edney 1986). Moreover, the imperative to protect a nation not just in the West but also abroad provided the impetus for a much more organized approach to mapping movement in the military. Particularly relevant here is the advent of aviation in the early twentieth century, which brought cartography into yet another dimension: That of aeronautical charts. The US Army had led the effort to chart military effort through its Signal Corps, which developed a system of signs and symbols that would facilitate air travel. Most of these charts, however, were published by the Rand McNally Company, the US Post Office, and the US Geological Survey. An especially unusual type of “air map” was introduced toward the end of the Second World War: <a href="//state-and-federal/1944-silk-chart">Cloth charts designed to aid downed pilots in enemy territory</a>, particularly in the Pacific theater. The Army Map Service began producing these on a large scale in the summer of 1943, and by February 1945 was issuing 250,000 per month. This example is from the Eastern Asia series, which were initially printed in early 1944, though may not have been issued to troops given that the surrender of Japan ended the need for an invasion. Most of the maps (printed on both sides of the cloth) included information relevant to escape and evasion, such as landmarks, language, the location of small villages and transportation networks (Doll 1988).</p>

<h3>Maps for National Infrastructure and Internal Improvements</h3>
<p>The term “internal improvements” was initially used in the 1780s to indicate any effort to strengthen US prosperity and security, but soon thereafter the term came to mean canals, roads, schools, and other public projects. Significantly, as historian John Lauritz Larson writes, the concept became synonymous with public works to advance transportation, “because in the sprawling continental Union nothing threatened the mutual interests of the citizens and their states like geographical isolation” (Larson 2001, 3). The sheer territorial reach of the new republic made transportation networks particularly important. Yet like the history of reconnaissance and exploration discussed above, efforts to build infrastructure only gradually moved from sporadic and ad hoc projects to a more systematic commitment on the part of the federal and state governments. The maps reveal this trajectory.</p>
<p>The achievement of independence from Britain keenly brought home the need to address the nation’s infrastructure. Yet because few privately produced maps adequately covered the national transportation network, Congress directed the Postmaster General to survey and map the system of roads. Abraham Bradley, a clerk in the Post Office, responded by creating a comprehensive picture of infrastructure and movement through his national map of the nation’s post offices and roads. Such a map profiled not topography or borders—as most maps do—but rather a web of communication that networked the new nation. Bradley issued new editions of his map several times over the next two three decades (Caldwell and Buehler 2010, 7).</p>
<p>Bradley’s maps suggest attuned to the demands of infrastructure, yet Americans arguing for internal improvements generally faced an uphill battle. President Washington expressed enthusiasm for a more comprehensive system linking the waterways of the Ohio River with eastern rivers, yet grand visions such as these faced ongoing resistance from localism and regional agendas. Indeed it was this persistent parochialism that led Congress to ask Treasury Secretary Albert Gallatin to survey the new nation’s entire transportation system in 1807. Gallatin’s extensive research prioritized the improvement of communication and transportation along the coast as well as connecting the seaboard to the interior. More specifically, he stressed the importance of a road that would traverse the Appalachian Mountains and a canal that would connect the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes. Finally, Gallatin believed that eastern geography could facilitate inland navigation, for the coastline was largely protected from storms as well as enemies. From Massachusetts to southern Georgia, he observed, the coast was interrupted by four necks of land; four canals could exploit this natural geography and vastly improve inland navigation (McLaughlin 1973,173).</p>
<p>Though not all of these recommendations were ultimately taken up by the federal government, the nation went through a boom in canal building in subsequent decades, and many of these closely followed Gallatin’s recommendations. In light of this, it makes sense that Carter Goodrich has called Gallatin’s report the “greatest planning document in American history” (Goodrich 1960, 3; Gallatin 1808, 725). Yet the ambitious nature of the plan also limited its implementation. The sums requested were enormous, and the plan required a level of coordination across states and regions that simply did not exist in the new republic.</p>
<p>Once the US again went to war with Great Britain in 1812, however, Gallatin’s emphasis on internal improvements in such a geographically extensive republic looked increasingly prescient. Though the war delayed action on his specific proposals, it immediately drew attention to the need for improved roads to move armies rapidly. Thus one of the first aspects of Gallatin’s report to receive material attention was a national road, ultimately completed in 1818. The next year, Secretary of War John C. Calhoun reaffirmed the need for a national system of roads and canals, which in turn prompted President James Monroe to appoint a Board of Engineers for Internal Improvements, which lasted only seven years but which was continued by the Topographical Bureau. The Bureau oversaw the survey and construction of basic transportation, and in turn spawned the Corps of Engineers and the Corps of Topographical Engineers, which profoundly influenced the planning and surveying of roads, canals, and railroads. Yet obstacles to a national plan of improvements continued, rooted in “local jealousies, rival jurisdictions, vested interests, straitened purses, and the preferences of local capital for less extravagant (and more immediately rewarding) projects” (Larson 2001, 69).</p>
<p>A few of the proposals outlined in Gallatin’s report were eventually carried out at by states rather than the federal government. Near Louisville, Kentucky, navigation of the Ohio River was nearly impossible due to its rocky shoals. Limestone underlay the entire width of the river for a stretch of two miles, essentially forming a natural dam that left the river low and navigation hazardous if not impossible for much of the year. Settlers had noticed the problem as early as the 1770s, but only with the growth of river traffic at the turn of the century did the concept of a canal to bypass the shoals gain any traction. Several private companies—charted by the bordering state and territorial legislatures—studied possible improvements, but could not agree on the location for the project (Robinson 1983; Johnson 1974).</p>
<p>In 1804, the citizens of Louisville organized a state-chartered company, the Ohio Canal Company, and hired a former officer of the Corps of Engineers named Jared Brooks to survey the falls and propose a canal for the Kentucky side of the river. Brooks produced <a href="/state-and-federal/1808-rapids-ohio#top">a detailed survey that laid out the route that would be realized many years later</a>. In December 1805, the Kentucky governor and legislature sent Brooks’s report and map to Congress, arguing that such a canal was in the national interest and merited federal support. Kentucky Senator Henry Clay authorized further study under Gallatin’s inventory of the nation’s transportation network in 1807. Gallatin learned of the Louisville Canal proposal and asked for further information, which Brooks supplied in the form of a lengthy report as well as several maps. In response, Gallatin recommended that $300,000 be appropriated for the project, though no action was taken (Johnson 1974, 59, Gallatin 1808, 821-826).</p>
<p>The economic importance of steamboat navigation after the War of 1812 made navigational improvements to the falls imperative. A commission representing all the states of the Ohio Valley united behind a Kentucky canal based on Brooks’s earlier surveys and maps. In 1825 the Commonwealth of Kentucky chartered the Louisville and Portland Canal Company, which, with state and federal funds, constructed a canal that circumvented the falls. The canal was completed in 1830 and opened for navigation that December. Many hoped Congress would make this a national project, while others vehemently insisted that this was well beyond federal control and the authority of the US. Decades later, the federal government’s investment in the canal had increased to the point that it was almost entirely in control, and after the Civil War the canal was transferred to the US Army Corps of Engineers.</p>
<p>An even more impressive engineering feat was the construction of the Erie Canal. Gallatin had proposed two shorter canals rather than <a href="/state-and-federal/1821-canal-lake-erie#top">the single canal extending all the way from the Hudson River to Lake Erie</a>. Many thought the idea of a 350-mile canal an impossibility, especially one built through wilderness, but the allure of capturing the trade of the upper Great Lakes and the American West beyond was undeniable. To pursue this goal the State of New York organized a Canal Commission in 1810, and attempted to enlist the help of the Federal government and neighboring states. When no cooperation was forthcoming, New Yorkers undertook the project themselves, led by Canal Commissioner (and eventual New York State Governor) DeWitt Clinton. Construction began on Independence Day, 1817, and the canal opened in late 1825, when Clinton famously poured a keg of water from Lake Erie into the Atlantic Ocean. Soon thereafter, the tonnage transported on the canal began to rival that of the entire Mississippi River system, stimulating eastern commerce as well as the growth of regions connected to the canal. (Goodrich, 1960, 53)</p>
<p>There was an equally intense period of canal building on the other side of the Great Lakes. For instance, in the 1810s Secretary Calhoun proposed a canal to connect Lake Michigan to the Illinois River (and thus to the Mississippi River and ultimately New Orleans), though construction did not begin until 1836. After several delays, the canal opened in 1848, and immediately began to siphon the Illinois River Valley agriculture away from its market in St. Louis to a new one in Chicago. The success of this canal brought more commerce from Lake Michigan through the Chicago River, but the situation of the Chicago Harbor remained an obstacle to growth: The River was notoriously difficult to navigate where it met the Lake, particularly given a persistent sandbar that returned despite repeated dredging attempts by the military (Holland 2005).</p>
<p>The Corps of Engineers sent James Duncan Graham to address the problem in 1854. Graham had been involved in settling boundary disputes on the nation’s northern and southern borders for several years before supervising harbor improvements in its northern lakes. He made <a href="/state-and-federal/1858-chicago-harbor#top">detailed surveys of the harbor as part of a larger report to the Corps that included a map</a>, one of the first achievements of the famed lithographer Julius Bien. The map details the complicated contours of the harbor and river, as well as the proposed improvements. Once the Civil War began, Chicago became an important supply center for the Union Army, which ensured ongoing maintenance of the harbor.</p>
<p>The essential role of the military in initiating the improvement of the Chicago Harbor underscores its more general role in advancing infrastructure. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the transcontinental railroad, which became a national goal when Congress authorized the survey of possible routes in March 1853 under the supervision of Secretary of War Jefferson Davis. These ambitious surveys generated remarkably detailed reports that served as topographic and scientific documents but also blueprints for western development. The large “Map of the Territory” (1857) made by Gouverneur Kemble Warren (later famed for leading the defense of Little Round Top during the Battle of Gettysburg) stands as one of the most impressive maps that emerged from these surveys, a synthesis of prior federal exploration and a master map of the West. The individual surveys were also notable, documenting the various features of the seen and unseen landscape. For instance, Isaac Stevens used the cutting-edge technique of using lines to map average temperature in his “Isothermal chart of the region north of the 36th Parallel” (1859). Here the continent was profiled not through the familiar lenses of topographic contours or political boundaries, but in terms of environmental dynamics, which in turn allowed for an assessment of the region’s potential for settlement and development.</p>
<p>In the end, however, the path of the transcontinental railroad was determined not by the extensive efforts of the Pacific Railroad Surveys but the decision of eleven slaveholding states to secede from the Union. This ensured that any transcontinental route would be a northern one, yet the exact path remained to be determined. The process of settling on that precise route is at work in a manuscript map made under the direction of Union officer Grenville Mellen Dodge, military commander of the Missouri at the end of the Civil War. The leaders of the Union Pacific Railroad were keenly aware that they must address the threat of Indian attacks in order to construct the line itself. The several territories (as well as the state of Kansas) that were connected to the proposed route were all put under the direction of Dodge, whose task was to survey the geography and people of what was to both government and industry a relatively unknown region. The resulting “<a href="/state-and-federal/1866-union-pacific-rr#top">Map of the Military District</a>” was completed in January 1866 and based on information gathered from scouting parties as well as military and railroad engineers.</p>
<p>During an 1865 campaign against Indians in Wyoming, Dodge claimed to have found a route over the Rocky Mountains, west of the Platte River through the future locations of Cheyenne and Laramie. In May 1866 he left the military entirely to become chief engineer for the Union Pacific, bringing his considerable surveying expertise with him. Thus the map ended up not only detailing the topography of a relatively unknown region, but also played a role in persuading the directors of the Union Pacific in the fall of 1866 to consider an alternate route through the Rockies. Though he exaggerated his role in constructing (as opposed to surveying) this route, it is indeed Dodge who appears at the center of the famous photograph of Promontory Point, Utah, where the Central and Union Pacific Railroads were joined and commemorated with a symbolic Golden Spike in 1869.</p>
<p>The growth of transcontinental rail networks in the late nineteenth century was both a cause and consequence of industrialization. Such explosive development drew US attention beyond the Great West to markets overseas, and reintroduced the prospect of an interoceanic canal in Central America. The idea of an interoceanic passage had been vigorously discussed in the United States and Europe throughout the nineteenth century. The success of the Suez Canal in 1869 revived interest in a similar project in the Americas, and French interests capitalized on that momentum by authorizing Ferdinand De Lesseps to create another sea-level canal at Panama. But various challenges, both human and natural, foiled this second act, and by the 1880s the French had given up. By the turn of the century, American expansion into the Pacific, with the acquisition of Hawaii and the Philippines, and into the Caribbean made clear that an isthmian passage could bring tremendous rewards.</p>
<p>Congress authorized the construction of an isthmian canal in 1902, and President Roosevelt gave broad latitude to a board made up of civilian and military engineers to consider the advantages of a sea-level canal (as in Suez) versus the lock-canals, which Americans had so frequently built in the 1820s and 1830s. After visiting the isthmus, the Board of Engineers produced a report supported by several maps and cross-sections that illustrated <a href="/state-and-federal/1905-panama-canal#top">plans for a sea level canal as well as different heights of lock canals</a>. The report considered both commercial and defensive priorities, as well as the cost and speed of construction. Ultimately, however, the commissioners deadlocked over which option to recommend. Both the Isthmian Canal Commission and the Board were divided, with the European engineers solidly supporting of the sea-level canal, and the Americans (as well as the chief engineer) squarely in favor of the lock-canal. President Roosevelt and his Secretary of War, William Taft, also backed the lock-canal, with a preference for a surface of eighty-five feet above sea level. After it opened in 1914, the canal allowed ships to travel between the North Atlantic and Pacific Oceans in half the time it had taken to go around the tip of South America.</p>
<p>If the Panama Canal illustrates how engineering can transform nature, there are equally dramatic examples of the limits of human power to subdue the same. Consider the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, when heavy rains swelled the river beyond its banks and broke the existing levees that had been constructed to prevent just such a catastrophe. In the aftermath of the floods, the Army Corps of Engineers carried out flood control and bank stabilization through the work of the Mississippi River Commission. A young geologist working for the Louisiana Geological Survey, Harold Norman Fisk, persuaded the Commission to support his ambitious effort to <a href="/state-and-federal/1945-ancient-courses#top">map the geological history of the entire lower Mississippi River</a>. Fisk was not just interested in improving movement on the river, he was attuned to the evolution of the river. Through creative fieldwork, archival research, and aeronautical photography, Fisk was able to reconstruct the deep history of the river over thousands of years. Through his massive report and dozens of maps, Fisk brought a new level of sophistication to mapping the river, and thereby opened up new ways for engineers to think about its behavior.</p>

<h3>Maps as Historical Clues</h3>
<p>Even this brief consideration demonstrates the ongoing—if inconsistent—federal and state use of maps for exploration, reconnaissance, and the development of infrastructure. At no time in the nation’s history was government shy about using cartography to advance these interests, though certainly its ambitions often outpaced its resources and collective will. To examine even these ten examples is to see moments where particular interests aligned to enlist federal and state resources to advance their purposes. The twentieth century brought a much greater and more consistent investment of federal and state resources, and the output far more systematic. Consider also the many examples of mapping movement treated elsewhere in this online collection, such as the great geological surveys in the American West, particularly the efforts of the Bureau of Topographical Engineers and the Great Surveys; maps used to lure railroad companies and individual settlers into the West after the Civil War; Signal Corps maps of the expanding telegraph system both at home and abroad at the turn of the century; the development of highway maps by state and federal agencies to match the public’s boundless demand for automobile travel in the twentieth century; and planning maps to reckon with the resulting urban growth. Gallatin’s vision of a government dedicated to advancing the national interest and economic welfare would arrive, just much later than he expected.</p>

  return `<p>Most of the maps we use in everyday life are designed to make complex transportation systems seem simple. Highway maps often omit railroad lines that are vital for industry but are not as important to passenger travel. Toll-road maps regularly highlight intersections where motorists can enter and exit. Subway and other transit-system maps are highly stylized to make twisting and turning routes appear more direct than they actually are. Such simplifications are made to avoid overwhelming map users who merely want to get from one place to the next as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Maps used by transportation planners, by contrast, can be unabashedly complex. Whether prepared by public or private institutions, they often depict multiple transportation modes as well as the terminals, industrial districts, and freight yards that support them. Showing these facilities helps achieve the dual purpose of educating citizens about the status of transportation systems while providing planners and other stakeholders with the technical perspective needed to manage them.</p>
<p>This essay focuses on the latter category—the maps used to study transportation systems in urban and metropolitan regions. This includes both systems already in existence and those proposed, a distinction that often affects their orientation and design. When viewed chronologically, the changing features of these maps are fascinating testimonials to the aspirations of planners during the various phases of transportation development. For example, the following maps illuminate the ebb and flow of planning history, and how professional planners have gradually expanded their focus beyond city blocks and neighborhoods to vast metropolitan regions.</p>
<p>Evaluating the maps used by transportation planners also shines light on the gradual advances in technology that have improved cartography. Most maps were quite primitive 150 years ago. Railroad lines and roads were often shown in uniform width, regardless of their relative importance. Coastlines, despite being unchanged for centuries, were relatively crude approximations, and cities were typically represented with mere dots or blotches, regardless of their actual shape. Some maps were <em>intentionally</em> simple, such as when their creators sought to convey a basic message or idea, but more often than not, mapmaking was constrained by the available information and technology.</p>
<p>By the late nineteenth century, however, maps began to offer a veritable feast of vivid colors and details. Creative schemes, abetted by lithography and involving color-coding, the use of symbols, and tiny but easy-to-read text, came to the fore. In the 1940s and 50s, the complexity of printed maps arguably reached its zenith, as planners commissioned works that were packed with urban land-use and transportation information. The 1990s brought another metamorphosis, this time in the direction of technical precision thanks to the advent of satellite-based geographic information systems.</p>
<p>Regardless of the era, however, it remains necessary to ask <em>why</em> a map was created to understand its importance. Was it to convey complex data to help decisionmakers assess the technical feasibility of investments and engineering options? Or to impress upon the public the acumen of public agencies? Or to engage the public in an open and meaningful dialogue about the possibilities that lie ahead?</p>
<p>Today, as technology advances at breakneck speed, interactive three-dimensional views, shape files, and data layering allow transportation problems to be studied in previously impossible ways. Yet, as we will see, contemporary mapmakers continue to stand on the shoulders of pioneering cartographers who have made enormous efforts to document the arrangement of transportation systems in metropolitan regions for the benefit of future generations.</p>

<h3>Railroads, Rivers, and Wharves: 1835–1899</h3>
<p>In the first half of the eighteenth century, private companies and public officials relied heavily on engineering drawings and blueprints that depicted the layout of transportation facilities. These works showcased the spatial configuration of buildings, roads, and, other physical assets in a relatively small area as accurately as possible at the time.</p>
<p>By contrast, most maps of this era depicting more expansive areas, such as metropolitan boundaries, were not drawn with such attention to detail. This was due to the fact that there simply wasn’t a strong demand for such information, and was exacerbated by the technological limitation of this era. For example, communities were often shown merely as black circles, rivers as thin undulating lines, existing railroads and canals as thicker black lines, and canal and railroad construction as dashed lines that did not reflect the exact routes that would be followed. Maps in the <em>Official Guide of the Railways</em> through the 1860s exemplify this propensity for simplification during this era.</p>
<p>In some cases, governments attempted to compensate for the simplicity of their maps and drawings by making them quite large. <a href="/planning-transportation/1836-north-river#top">The adjacent map, published by the New York City Board of Aldermen in 1836</a>, is an excellent example of this. Users taking the time to unfold this irregularly shaped map, which measures six feet wide by five feet tall, must have been impressed by its extravagant proportions. The map shows the proposed “Great Pier” in the North River— at the time a popular alternate name for the Hudson River—on Manhattan Island. Details of the surrounding neighborhood, however, are scant; and by contemporary standards, the rendering is more akin to a giant sketch.</p>
<p>The exactitude and quantity of detail on transportation maps grew sharply between 1870 and 1890, in part due to breakthroughs in publishing technology, aerial photography, and the growing ambition of planners. Changes in printing technology, from engraving to lithography, added to the richness of this finished product. As cities industrialized and became more crowded, planners increasingly looked to cultivate public support that was necessary to finance transportation improvements. Efforts to relocate railroads, build more efficient passenger terminals, create landfills in harbors and lakes (often to provide more suitable arrangements for industry), and improve city streets, rose in priority. The illustrations created to support these projects, however, still tended to resemble elaborate line drawings rather than formal maps, and they were distributed only sparingly to the general public by government agencies.</p>
<p>Why did the government shy away from creating and distributing more elaborate maps? This was due in part to their lack of financial and legal capacity to make most large-scale initiatives a reality. Many had to rely on private firms, such as railroad companies, to complete large-scale tasks. Yet the relationship between cities and railroad lines was often characterized by suspicion and mistrust.</p>
<p>The necessity for railroad support of transportation-improvement plans can be appreciated when studying <a href="/planning-transportation/1876-railway-philadelphia/#top">the adjacent map created by a private firm for tourists and travelers visiting the 1876 Centennial International Exhibition held in Philadelphia</a>. One of the country’s first great railroad-oriented fairs, this exposition marked the 100th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence. This map includes a labyrinth of railroad lines, stations, roads, and streetcar and ferry routes permeated the city, although, as with other maps of this era, they are depicted in a relatively simple way.</p>
<p>Maps began to be used more extensively to educate the public about the benefits of government action in the early 1890s, as the Progressive Era bloomed. Civic leaders sought to harness scientific advancements, new techniques in public administration, and emerging technologies to improve the performance of cities. Maps became focal points of elaborate presentations calling for far-flung transportation projects built around clearly defined objectives. Planners and civic leaders wanted maps not only to support more enlightened policymakers, but also to engage everyday people who had little technical knowledge in a meaningful debate about the opportunities awaiting their community.</p>
<p>The use of maps reached new heights after the World’s Columbian Exposition was held in Chicago during 1893-94. This fair’s architectural splendor gave rise to the “City Beautiful Movement,” which was built on the idea that cities could be transformed from the dangerous, dirty, and noisy places they had become into inspiring destinations that cultivated a stronger sense of civic virtue, pride, and citizenship. As interest in city planning grew, Daniel Burnham—the fair’s director of works—and other architect-planners rose to positions of great public prominence.</p>
<p>By the late 1890s, elaborate maps were being commissioned to educate citizens about the need for wholesale changes to city streets, waterfronts, and rail terminals. Maps were published in ever-rising numbers to encourage voters to support the issuance of bonds (i.e., public debt) to fund infrastructure projects overseen by newly-formed public works departments. Spending funds wisely required that governments develop comprehensive neighborhood strategies to win the hearts of the populace, which raised the demand for mapmaking.</p>
<p>Few municipalities had bona fide planning or transportation departments as we know them today, and the advent of zoning (or “districting,” as land-use controls were called at the time) was still decades away. Still, in the spirit of Progressivism, governments were on the move, seeking enlightened solutions to lingering urban problems.</p>
<p>The result was a metamorphosis in map production, which gave rise to some of the first large-format color maps showing metropolitan regions in breathtaking detail. <a href="/planning-transportation/1895-road-map-ny#top">The adjacent map of New York City, produced by Rand McNally in 1896</a>, was years ahead of its time, illustrating in vivid detail the juxtaposition of industry, parks, railroads, ground transportation, marine shipping, waterworks, and other features. Creating a foldable map with such intricate detail would have been unimaginable just a decade earlier—and was in fact still unaffordable for most smaller cities—but could be done in New York by virtue of the enormous consumer demand and growing amount of information being made available by governments.</p>
<p>In an attempt to help planners look more systematically at urban problems, maps increasingly used color-coding to depict complex aspects of transportation systems. <a href="/planning-transportation/1898-property-chicago#top">The adjacent map of Chicago’s rail system, circa 1895</a>, uses more than a dozen distinct color schemes to denote major railroads and their terminals. Abetted by the city’s well-developed aerial-photography industry, this map shows the arrangement of tracks in such rich detail that the user might feel that he or she is in a hot-air balloon above the city. Without aerial photography, it would have taken a staggering amount of field work to develop such a vivid and accurate portrayal of this area’s man-made environment. It only takes a quick look at the spaghetti-bowl of railroad tracks and terminals to appreciate Carl Sandburg’s description of the Windy City as the “Tool Maker, Stacker of Wheat, Player with Railroads and Freight Handler to the Nation.”</p>

<h3>Using Maps to Inspire: The Early Twentieth Century</h3>
<p>The power of maps to educate and inspire citizens—and to encourage them to rally around the ambitious programs envisioned by civic leaders—was used to particularly great effect by Daniel Burnham in the early twentieth century. This acclaimed Beaux-Arts architect, and a key figure in the City Beautiful Movement, achieved great fame with his plans for Cleveland (1903), San Francisco (1905), and Manila, the Philippines (1906). His plans emphasized the <em>physical city</em>, with grand boulevards and parkways, majestic buildings, and inviting public spaces.</p>
<p>The Merchants Club of Chicago persuaded Burnham to embark on a plan for the Windy City in 1906. Almost immediately, Burnham retained Edward E. Bennett, a young Beaux-Arts designer and architect, to coauthor this plan. This enterprising pair recognized the strong emotional appeal of color drawings and maps to the public, and made them centerpieces of their emerging plan. Using lofty prose, maps, and lavish illustrations that reminded readers of the bold projects that reshaped great European cities years earlier, Burnham and Bennett encouraged citizens to see the interconnection between transportation and other social and industrial issues and, ultimately, support actions intended to dramatically improve their city.</p>
<p>A team of draftsmen and two illustrators, Jules Guerin and Fernand Javin, created vivid pastel renderings for the <em>Plan of Chicago</em>. These renderings captured the attention of readers and encouraged them to contemplate the benefits of government-led action to reshape vast tracts of urban land. Such renderings were often accompanied by maps depicting possible arrangements for streets and boulevards, railroad terminals, and new parks and lagoons—all in spectacular detail. Less attention was paid to producing renderings with similarly exacting details, as on the previous New York City example. Burnham and Bennett evidently felt a sense of artistic license and instead created inspiring illustrations depicting the many opportunities that beckoned.</p>
<p>Upon its completion in 1909, more than 1,600 copies of <em>The Plan of Chicago</em> were printed for public distribution. Maps in this plan, and those prepared for other cities, not only envisioned new boulevards and parks, but a future in which electric railways played an ever-expanding role. At the time, few planners appreciated just how profoundly the private automobile would shape the future of transportation.</p>
<p>Optimism about electric railways was galvanized by a flurry of “interurban” construction in the East, Midwest, and California at the time. A longer-distance adaptation of urban streetcar technology, interurbans were relatively cheap to build and rapidly transformed the way in which residents of many cities moved from place to place. Interurban and streetcar companies did their best to convince investors that they would generate enormous profits.</p>
<p>Maps showing interurban systems are often filled with nuance, not only because these maps focus on relatively small geographic areas, but also because many of these companies sought to impress investors and show how their routes reached the commercial hearts of the cities they served. Whereas maps of “steam railroads” (i.e., conventional railroads, powered at the time by steam locomotives) were often drawn to make their routes between cities appear as direct as possible, interurban maps typically showed routes threading their way down streets and boulevards.</p>
<p><a href="/planning-transportation/1911-electric-la#top">The adjacent 1911 map of the Pacific Electric Railway</a>—one of the Los Angeles region’s most prominent transportation companies a century ago—illustrates this point. This map does not try to conceal the fact that the company’s “Red Cars” had to wind their way through many neighborhoods. It also shows the number of tracks on each route and the dense network of tracks in some of the largest cities it served, such as Long Beach and Santa Monica.</p>
<p>Within a few years, however, much of the optimism surrounding interurban and streetcar lines had waned. By the middle of the 1910s, Henry Ford’s Model T was transforming the American way of life, and Ford had sold more than 700,000 vehicles by 1916. Interurban and streetcar companies suffered greatly as Americans shifted to cars, buses, and trucks. Having electric-railway tracks in the middle of city streets was increasingly viewed as a nuisance that hindered efficient traffic flow. By the late 1920s, most interurban companies and many streetcar lines had been put out of business by the new rubber-tired competition.</p>
<p>The spectacular growth in highway travel created a new set of transportation problems, and local governments were unprepared to deal with the situation. As drivers grew frustrated with bumpy, muddy, and congested roads, the paving and widening of streets, as well as the creation of an integrated system of highways, became matters of great urgency. While travelers may have been satisfied with trains for longer-distance journeys, many who could afford automobile travel demanded its convenience on short-distance trips.</p>

<h3>Rethinking Regions: Maps of the 1920s and 1930s</h3>
<p>During the “roaring twenties,” state governments commissioned many elaborate maps showing an interconnected network of arterial highways, and began to explore the possibility of “superhighways” that would permit non-stop driving over longer distances. The need to coordinate these investments fueled the nascent “regional planning movement,” built on the idea that coordinating public-works projects across large geographic regions was critical to good governance. Believing that all communities within a region—particularly those clustered around a major city—shared a common destiny, regional-planning proponents attempted to align urban transportation developments with the needs of expanding suburbia.</p>
<p>The creation of the Regional Planning Association (RPA) in metropolitan New York City in 1922 was a milestone in the movement, and similar organizations soon emerged in Chicago (through the leadership of Daniel Burnham, Jr., son of the famous architect) and Los Angeles. Organizations such as these understood the power of maps to enhance public appreciation for regional investments in airports, bridges, roads, and superhighways.</p>
<p>Regional planning organizations nevertheless lacked the power to regulate or levy taxes—they were not sanctioned governments—and instead relied heavily on the power of persuasion. When RPA issued a landmark two-volume plan in 1929, it set a new standard for using maps and technical illustrations to depict road and bridge building programs, while showing their relationships with other initiatives. Maps in the plan detailed how a major metropolitan area could greatly improve its transportation system—making maps from the Burnham era seem simple by comparison.</p>
<p>Maps produced for regional plans illustrated how highway development was linked to programs to expand forest preserves, parks, flood-control systems, among other goals. Regional planning associations also put great emphasis on airports. Not only was commercial aviation surging at the time, but the development of new and larger aircraft suggested that a revolution in passenger flight was on the horizon. Comparatively little attention was paid to public transit, housing, public safety, and schools. Social commentator Lewis Mumford, an outspoken critic of the movement, did not consider this to be regional planning at all, but merely “parks and highway planning.”</p>
<p>Although local governments mostly had to settle for incremental improvements, such as building overpasses or underpasses at railroad crossings, widening streets, and installing signals to regulate the flow of traffic, the construction of superhighways came to be seen as inevitable. By the early 1930s, reports and photographs of the new German autobahns—a prototype for the enhancement of intercity motor travel—had captured the American public’s attention.</p>
<p><a href="/planning-transportation/1937-new-england-regional#top">The adjacent map, prepared by the New England Regional Planning Commission in 1937</a>, illustrates how such goals were incorporated into regional plans of this era. Air routes link small cities to larger ones. Lengthy “limited way roads” (expressways) and “parkways” (highways through areas of natural beauty) slice through the countryside. Strategic locations for airports and seaplane terminals are clearly marked, while vast tracts of privately owned land are identified for new parkland and forest preserves. Tellingly, the region’s densely built rail network—apparently taken for granted—is not even shown.</p>
<p>The course of history, however, took an unplanned turn. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, almost all such regional transportation plans were put on hold.</p>

<h3>America on the Move: Maps after the Second World War</h3>
<p>Shortages of concrete, gasoline, labor, and steel necessitated that planners bide their time during the Second World War. After hostilities ceased, many mistakenly believed that a renaissance in the regional planning movement was around the corner.</p>
<p>The movement’s consensus-driven approach was out of sync with new programs coming out of Washington. Federal agencies preferred to work with state governments or newly created metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) that met strict new legal requirements (such as provisions that all residents of a region be equally represented in planning decisions). Many regional organizations folded or were merged into newly-formed governments. New York’s RPA was a notable exception, but many other organizations disappeared, including those in Chicago and Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Transportation planning became more formalized and guided by federal mandates and requirements. As the flow of federal dollars accelerated, county and state governments developed their own plans that mapped out new schemes for building airports, expressways, and rapid-transit lines. Cities braced for an anticipated surge in housing investment and population growth. <a href="/planning-transportation/1946-preliminary-chicago#top">The adjacent map, prepared by the Chicago Plan Commission in 1946</a>, illustrates the grandiosity typical of government-issued maps from this era. An enormous amount of information—such as existing rail, road, and water routes, as well as land uses, industrial areas, parkland, and proposed expressways—is included on this map as governments pushed ahead with long-delayed projects.</p>
<p>Metropolitan regions indeed boomed after the war, but the growth was much more concentrated in suburban areas than in the city. Growing numbers of residents abandoned deteriorating inner-city neighborhoods and moved to outlying areas that offered inexpensive new homes and quiet living on spacious lots. New suburban communities seemed blissfully isolated from the commotion and crowding of the central city.</p>
<p><a href="/planning-transportation/1951-valparaiso#top">The adjacent map, prepared by the city of Valparaiso, Ind., in 1951</a>, typifies how transportation planners began focusing on large geographic regions to accommodate the rapid outward migration of urban populations. A small county seat destined to feel the encroachment of metropolitan Chicago, Valparaiso braced for change as its giant neighbor grew ever closer.</p>
<p>Before the 1950s ended, the construction of superhighways had kicked into high gear. Interstate highways were considered essential not only to routine travel but also for the rapid evacuation of cities in the event of a nuclear attack. As tensions rose during the Cold War, local governments produced detailed maps solely to increase the odds that civilians would survive an atomic apocalypse. <a href="/planning-transportation/1961-new-orleans#top">The adjacent map, issued by the New Orleans Office of Civil Defense in 1961</a>, dramatically shows how governments studied “who should go where” during the panic-filled minutes that preceded a bombing. The Crescent City, of course, would later be thrust into the national spotlight for its infamous struggle to evacuate in the wake of Hurricane Katrina in 2005.</p>
<p>Building the Interstate Highway System required relocating tens of thousands of residents from inner-city neighborhoods. By the early 1950s, “fast and free” expressway travel was ushering in a new era in travel throughout the country. Yet the door to unimpeded expressway construction slammed shut in the mid-1960s as “expressway revolt” reared its head. New federal regulations required a closer link between transportation and other aspects of urban planning. These regulations, while mostly toothless, showed that the tide had turned.</p>
<p>The mass-transit improvements envisioned on <a href="/planning-transportation/1969-plan-nyc#top">the adjacent map, prepared in 1969 by the municipal government in New York City</a>, show how the pendulum had swung toward public transportation. This fascinating map, filled with ambitious proposals for new corridors, was produced shortly after plans to build a pair of elevated superhighways through the middle of Manhattan had been officially dropped. This shift in emphasis away from expressway construction was felt in other cities, as well. Beginning in the 1970s, new subway systems opened in Atlanta, Miami, Washington, D.C., and the San Francisco Bay Area, leading to the emergence of “light-rail” transit projects in large and small cities throughout the country.</p>

<h3>Modesty and Metamorphosis: 1980–Present</h3>
<p>Maps outlining bold plans for regional transportation improvement became less prevalent during the mid-1980s and the early 1990s. As funding for large-scale projects dried up, many agencies opted for simple “concept plans,” short on specifics and lacking detailed maps. Some came to view master plans—and their associated maps—as destined to collect dust on library shelves. Although many light-rail systems and circumferential “beltway” highways around cities were built during this period, such projects often were not guided by overarching master plans of the type published several decades earlier.</p>
<p>Large-scale maps for transportation planning staged a comeback in the 1990s, due to a resurgent economy, the renewed vitality of many downtown areas, and growing interest in expanding and improving public transportation. Transportation-planning maps increasingly focused on “transit-oriented development” and schemes to modernize aging infrastructure. Geographic information systems (GIS), meanwhile, allowed cartographers to show relationships between transportation and other activities, including land use, in increasingly sophisticated ways.</p>
<p>Advances such as Google Maps and hand-held display devices, meanwhile, have brought sophisticated mapping tools to the masses and reduced the importance of printed maps. Interactive digital maps have also allowed users to select only the variables and topographic features they want to see, giving maps a more dynamic quality. Internet-driven “geo-coded” databases have allowed users to see the same region in a variety of ways—whether depicting transportation lines and traffic flow, street-level or satellite views, or driving and other navigation options.</p>
<p>At the same time, demand for planning maps that encompass not only metropolitan regions but entire intercity corridors, depicting numerous large cities situated along routes 100 and 500 miles long, has grown. Proposals for high-speed rail systems, conventional bus and train service, and waterway improvement programs often require governments to use maps to bring geographically dispersed areas to pursue a common goal, much like Burnham had done in a more urban context years ago.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the magnificent transportation maps of the past remain beacons of clarity that pointed the way toward making cities and metropolitan regions better places. Printed maps such as these teach us a great deal about the aspirations of planners, industry leaders, and civic advocates. As noted novelist Reif Larsen wrote, “A map does not just chart, it unlocks and formulates meaning; it forms bridges between here and there, between disparate ideas that we did not know were previously connected.”</p>

<h3>Further Reading</h3>
<p>Readers interested in the interplay between transportation systems and the development of cities will find an abundance of classic readings available to them. Among these, John Stilgoe’s <em>Metropolitan Corridor: Railroads and the American Scene</em> (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1985) stands out for its eloquent description the manner in which railroad routes enhanced the cosmopolitan qualities of small and large cities. Tom Lewis’ <em>Divided Highways: Building the Interstate Highways, Transforming American Life</em> (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2013) is also widely regarded for exploring the societal forces unleashed by new limited-access highways starting in the late 1950s as well as for his commentary on the consequences of these roads have had on the spatial and cultural fabric of cities.</p>
<p>Those interested in patterns of development in individual cities will find a particularly wide range of materials on Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York. D.A. Johnson’s <em>Planning the Great Metropolis: The 1929 Regional Plan of New York and its Environs</em> (London: Routledge, 1995) and Sarah Bradford Landau and Carl W. Condit’s <em>Rise of the New York Skyscraper: 1865-1913</em> describe the changing character of metropolitan and central-city development, respectively, centering on Manhattan throughout the early twentieth century. Spencer Crump’s crisply written <em>Ride the Big Red Cars: How Trolleys Helped Build Southern California</em> (Glendale, CA: Trans-Anglo Books, 1962) describes the transformative effects the Pacific Electric’s interurban network had on metropolitan Los Angeles, while David C. Sloane’s <em>Planning Los Angeles</em> (Chicago: American Planning Association, 2012), offers a nuanced look at the way land-use policies shaped the region’s growth. Critiques of the Windy City can be found in D. Bradford Hunt and Jon B. DeVries’ <em>Planning Chicago</em> (Chicago: American Planning Association, 2012) and my own <em>Beyond Burnham: An Illustrated History of Planning for the Chicago Region</em>, written with Alan M. Mammoser (Lake Forest, IL: Lake Forest University Press, 2009).</p>
<p>The importance of high-quality cartography in helping the general public understand the complexity of transportation networks is vividly illustrated by Mark Ovenden’s <em>Transit Maps of the World</em> (London: Penguin 2007). Similarly, Trains magazine popular “Map of the Month” series offers technical perspective on the relationship of rail lines and urban development. An archive of these maps can be found on the Kalmbach Publishing’s website: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201024184307/http://trn.trains.com/" rel="nofollow">trn.trains.com</a>, although these documents are free for download only to magazine subscribers. An excellent overview of evolution of railroad route maps, as well as many downloadable works, may be found on the Library of Congress website at: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201024184307/http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/gmdhtml/rrhtml/rrintro.html" rel="nofollow">memory.loc.gov/ammem/gmdhtml/rrhtml/rrintro.html</a>.

  return `<h3>The Spanish <em>Entrada</em></h3>
<p>The earliest trails of the Great West of North America were those blazed by Indians, and many of them, such as the Comanche Trail across Texas and New Mexico, followed the even older seasonal migration routes buffalo and other wild game. As demonstrated by the archeological remains of trade goods uncovered in the region (parrot feathers, pottery, textiles, seeds, foodstuffs, etc.), interconnected networks of Indian pathways stretched northward from the empires of the Mayas and Aztecs in southern and central Mexico into the Greater Southwest of what are now northern Mexico, New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, and Colorado and back, well before the coming of Europeans. Yet other systems of east-west trails linked the peoples of the Great Plains with those of the Greater Southwest and the Pacific Coast. While less demanding tracks over the land and the availability of water and sustenance were key to the establishment of these courses, there is, regrettably, no surviving print record of any route maps that may have been made by Indian travelers of these traces.  </p>
<p>When Europeans and, later, Euro-Americans initially came to the West, they regularly journeyed along the traces pioneered by the Indians. Spanish travelers were the first to come. Within the decade after the conquest of the Aztec Empire by Hernando Cortés in 1521, they began moving northward from Mexico City, seeking more fortune and glory for their God, their king, and for themselves. Specifically, they searched for the mines that were the sources of the silver and gold of the Aztecs and then for more Aztec- and Inca-like civilizations, such as the rumored Seven Cities of Cibola and their riches of gold and turquoise. Toward achieving the latter of those ends, the <em>entradas</em> of Pánfilo de Narváez and Alvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca in 1527-1537, Fray Marcos de Niza and Francisco Vázquez de Coronado in 1539-1542, and Hernando de Soto and Luis de Moscoso in 1539-1543, followed the Indian trails of what is now the southwestern United States, chronicling and mapping their travels along the way.  </p>
<p>In 1598, Juan de Onate led a large party of military and settlers northward from Chihuahua via <em>El Paso del Norte</em> along the Rio Grande to take formal possession of New Mexico. In July, he founded his first capital at the Tewa village of Ohkay Owingeh (Pueblo of San Juan). This capital was moved to the new village of Santa Fe in 1610. Onate explored and mapped New Mexico, especially to the west to find an overland route to California, until he was replaced as governor in 1608. Thereafter, in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the Spanish turned the old Indian trails stretching northward from Mexico City into <em>El Camino Real</em> (“the royal road”), connecting Mexico City via El Paso with Santa Fe and Taos in New Mexico in the north and via Tubac in Arizona with Los Angeles and San Francisco in Alta California in the northwest. Soldiers, immigrants, trade, and vital communications regularly traveled, locally and over longer distances, on these first European roads into the West. <a href="/maps-of-trails-and-roads/1811-road-from-capital-of-new-spain#top">Alexander von Humboldt’s <em>derroterro</em> or route map, “<em>Carte de la Route qui méne depuis la Capitale de la Nouvelle Espagne jusqu’à S. Fe du Nouveau Mexique…</em>”</a>, published in Paris in 1811, fully details <em>El Camino Real</em> from Mexico City.  </p>
<p>At about the same time as Daniel Boone was leading British settlers from Virginia through the Cumberland Gap in the Appalachian Mountains on the Cumberland or Wilderness Trail (which was eventually surpassed by canals and riverboats) west onto the Kentucky frontier in the 1770s, several Spanish parties were trying to find a way between Santa Fe and Los Angeles and San Francisco. The Domínguez-Escalante Expedition, under the leadership of frays Atanasio Domínguez and Silvestre Vélez de Escalante and accompanied by the soldier-engineer and cartographer Bernardo de Miera y Pacheco, in 1776-1777 penetrated into south central Utah before returning to Santa Fe. A product of this exploration was <a href="/maps-of-trails-and-roads/1779-map-of-the-province-of-new-mexico#top">Miera’s important manuscript map, the “<em>Plano de la Provincia Interna del Nuevo Mexico…</em>”</a>, completed in Santa Fe in 1777 and in several copies in 1778 and 1779. It documented the expedition’s traverses and much of what was known by the Spanish about the Southwest at the time. It also first revealed the larger eastern part of what would come to be known as the Old Spanish Trail and pioneered by the Domínguez-Escalante Expedition.  </p>
<p>Until the 1850s, the Old Spanish Trail was the major pack train trade route between Santa Fe and Los Angeles and San Francisco. Textiles made by Indian and Spanish weavers from the wool of New Mexican sheep were carried to California and traded for horses and mules that were then led back to Santa Fe to be sold. There was also a more localized trade in Indian (Ute and Paiute) slaves by Spanish, Mexican, and later Mormon traders along the New Mexico-Utah part of the trail. The Old Spanish Trail in its maximum extent has been delineated clearly on the significant <a href="/maps-of-trails-and-roads/1846-new-map-of-texas#top">“A New Map of Texas Oregon and California…” by Samuel Augustus Mitchell</a>, published in Philadelphia in 1846.  </p>
<p>Beginning in the 1821, the Santa Fe Trail linked much of the older Spanish-Mexican trail network, which the Americans would inherit a quarter of a century later, to the expanding United States. It became a major artery for trade, migration, and the military, reaching from Santa Fe eastward to central Missouri and Kansas until it was fully eclipsed by railroads 1880. The importance and popularity of the Santa Fe Trail is attested to by its prominence on many on many of the maps of the West of the day, including this map of 1846 by Samuel Augustus Mitchell.  </p>
<p>Near the end of the Mexican War of Independence from Spain (1810-1821), the Spanish government issued the first impresarial grant of land in Texas to the American Moses Austin to found a colony. The Austin Grant colonists, the “Old Three Hundred,” settled along the Brazos River in southeast Texas in 1822. Moses’ son, Stephen F. Austin, spent much of 1822-1823 in Mexico City to have the grant confirmed by the new government in 1823. As part of the approval, he agreed to produce and up-to-date map of the new Mexican state of <em>Coahuila y Tejas</em>, as it came to be called in 1824. Austin finished his map in 1829 and sent a copy in Spanish to the Mexican government as promised. He also had it published by H.S. Tanner of Philadelphia in 1830 as a <a href="/maps-of-trails-and-roads/1830-map-of-texas-with-parts#top">“Map of Texas with Parts of Adjoining States”</a>.  </p>
<p>Austin’s map not only provided Mexico with the most comprehensive rendering of Texas to date, but it also publicized the new Mexican state to the world at large. It indicated old and new settlements and the roads connecting them as well as emphasizing the region’s rivers and coastal harbors such as Galveston Bay. Indian tribes were located, and the map advertised “immense herds of buffalo” and “immense droves of wild horses.” Spanish-introduced free-range cattle also are mentioned. Clearly, this important map was intended to promote Texas and to lure US settlers to “Austin’s Colony,” which is one of only two with “Dewitt’s Colony” given prominence on it. The unexpected rapid influx of US settlers, legally and illegally, to the Austin and other impresario grants caused the Mexican government to impose ever greater restrictions on immigration to Texas that ultimately led to the Texas Revolution in 1835-1836 and the founding of the independent Republic of Texas. Austin’s map is a classic early example of immigrant cartography of the type that helped to open up not only Texas but the whole of the West to settlement.  </p>
<p>Throughout the nineteenth century, particularly commercial cartography production related to these and other trails became somewhat formulaic. The state and territorial maps picturing the routes appeared in a rapidly growing number of national atlases. The same maps were also left as single sheet flat maps or made into pocket maps. The use of pocket maps dates back to at least the second half of the seventeenth century, and this form was created essentially to satisfy the demand created by increasingly mobile middle-class Europeans. These Europeans needed the convenience of maps that could be carried with them on their trips to help them get where they were going and to tell them what it was like there and along the way. Pocket maps were constructed from the flat maps that were sectioned with the sections then affixed to cloth or canvas backings, and were folded along the gaps between the sections to fit in more confined spaces such as the pockets of travelers’ coats. Over time, the sizes of the maps when folded were in part governed by the whims of fashion and the subsequent changing configurations of pockets. Many late nineteenth century varieties were labeled “vest pocket maps.” The folded maps often were fitted with titled covers made of leather or other more rigid materials. The backings and covers prolonged the maps’ lives by allowing them to be consulted continually during travel. In due course, the use and increased popularity of pockets maps crossed the Atlantic to the Americas with European empires and their journeyers.  </p>

<h3>The Coming of the Americans</h3>
<p>Over the course of the nineteenth century, and especially after the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), the United States realized its “Manifest Destiny” to expand from the shores of the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific and beyond. Consequently, more and more people, US and European settlers streamed across the Mississippi River, lured by land for the taking, to find their fortunes and futures in the West. In addition to the Santa Fe Trail, numerous other overland trade and immigrant routes were opened up to various parts of the Great West. These new roads functioned not only to bring people to the frontier, but to supply their new settlements as well.  </p>
<p>The Oregon Country was a huge piece of territory, disputed over by Great Britain, Russia, Spain, and the United States, that included not only the present state of Oregon, but also Washington, Idaho, and parts of Montana and British Columbia. Its climate, rivers rich with fish and fur, timber resources, and potential farm lands invited settlement. The initial parts of the 2,000 mile wagon road known as the Oregon Trail that connected Independence, Missouri to the Willamette Valley in Oregon were laid out my mountain men and traders (following Indian trails) prior to 1840. Approximately 400,000 people eventually used the Oregon Trail during in the 1840s-1860s.  </p>
<p>In the 1820s-1840s, the British Hudson’s Bay Company developed its York Factory Express Route from its York Factory on Hudson’s Bay to its Fort Vancouver in Oregon, upstream from the American Fort Astoria on the Washington side of the Columbia River. Its primary purpose was to facilitate the Company’s fur trade with the Indians, not immigration, and it did not actually join the Oregon Trail. But other tracks did come together with it or branched off from it.  </p>
<p>In the 1840s-1860s, the California Trail dropped off to the southwest at Fort Hall in Idaho to reach the California goldfields. In 1849 alone it brought about 2,700 gold seekers and other settlers to California. The road from Independence to northern California too was about 2,000 miles long. During the same decades, tens of thousands of Mormons followed their leader Brigham Young from Nauvoo, Illinois along the Oregon and California trails to the Salt Lake Valley in Utah on what came to be known as the Mormon Trail. The Oregon Trail also was laid out on <a href="/maps-of-trails-and-roads/1846-new-map-of-texas#top">Mitchell’s “A New Map of Oregon Texas and California with Regions Adjoining…”</a> in 1846 as it was reaching its era of greatest usage. The terrains soon to be traversed by its branches to the gold fields of California and the promised land of Utah are shown as well.  </p>
<p>Two years later the seminal lithograph “Map of Oregon And Upper California From the Surveys of John Charles Fremont And Other Authorities,” drawn by Charles Preuss was published in Washington, DC. Fremont and Preuss were officers in the US Army Corps of Topographical Engineers, and this map marked the real beginning of the US scientific topographical mapping of the West. Although comparable to <a href="/maps-of-trails-and-roads/1846-new-map-of-texas#top">the Mitchell map</a>, it did not designate the specific trails, but it nevertheless more accurately show the way West through the Rockies, especially through the South Pass to San Francisco.  </p>
<p>First scouted by John Bozeman and John Jacobs in 1863, the Indian troubled Bozeman Trail branched off from the Oregon Trail west of Fort Laramie in Wyoming to reach northwestward through the Bozeman Pass into the gold and silver mining country around Virginia City, Montana well into the 1870s. The Bozeman Trail takes center stage on the large <a href="/maps-of-trails-and-roads/1870-territory-of-montana#top">“Map of the Territory of Montana with Portions of the Adjoining Territories”</a>, complied and drawn by Walter W. De Lacy of the surveyor general’s office in Helena and superbly engraved and commercially published by G.W. and C.B. Colton &amp; Co. of New York in 1870. This detailed map covers the Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho territories, accurately showing the various tracks and rivers through the rough topography of the Rocky Mountains to take travelers to mining camps, forts, and other settlements. The extensive Indian presence of tribes such as the Crow, Flatheads, and Nez Perce too are clearly indicated. The picture presented by this map underscores the fact that any journey undertaken in this region by the intrepid in search of mineral wealth, for land, or for other reasons, will not be any easy one.  </p>
<p>In addition to California and Montana, there were several other important gold and silver strikes that helped to open and populate the greater American West; among them were Colorado in 1858 and Alaska in 1896. Accordingly, numerous maps were produced by commercial and government enterprises to show the routes to miners and other immigrants to the sites of the potential new riches. The <a href="/maps-of-trails-and-roads/1859-route-from-kansas-city#top">“Map of Kansas with a Route from Kansas City to the Gold Mines”</a> is blatantly simple in showing the way across the Great Plains of Kansas and Colorado to the “Gold Region,” appropriately shaded yellow on an otherwise black-and-white rendering. Along the main track, which cuts across the “Great Santa Fe Trail,” settlements and possible campsites are indicated, as is Pike’s Peak near the end of the journey. To the north of the main track, the “South Platte Route” overland trail to the goldfields also is designated. The map is authored by Edward Mendenhall and Colonel William Gilpin (1834-1894), based in part on the 1849-1853 surveys of Captain John Williams Gunnison (1812-1853) of the US Army Corps of Topographical Engineers and published by in Cincinnati, Ohio by Middleton, Strobridge &amp; Co. in 1859.  </p>
<p>Similarly, <a href="/maps-of-trails-and-roads/1898-gold-and-coal-fields#top">“The Gold and Coal Fields of Alaska together with the Principal Routes and Trails”</a> by the US Coast and Geodetic Survey and US Geological Survey, published in Washington, DC in 1898, was one of the most authoritative maps showing the way to the Alaska gold rush. It includes not only Alaska but the Canadian Yukon Territory and British Columbia as well. Gold was also discovered in the Klondike region of the Yukon in 1896, setting of the great “Klondike Stampede,” and many of the “stampeders” reached the Canadian fields from Alaska. As the title of the map hintst, many people came to Alaska by sea from the West Coast of the United States proper, while others traveled overland through Canada. The locations of the known gold deposits are clearly marked on the map, and two insets show the routes to the headwaters of the Yukon River in Alaska and the Klondike region in Canada respectively. The existing courses from the various ports of entry to the gold fields too are demarcated. This map provides a good example of a government publication issued to encourage more orderly Western development during the nineteenth century.  </p>
<p>Parts of the great trail networks frequently were used by stage coaches and mail riders for more local travel and deliveries. Large stage lines such as those operated by John Butterfield and eventually Wells Fargo and numerous lesser ones also connected the trails with ever encroaching railroads that would eventually render the trails and even the coaches superfluous. Post roads and other mail routes had been indicated on American maps since colonial times by the Spanish and British and throughout the nineteenth century. In 1861-1862, in an experiment the United States moved mail swiftly from St. Louis, Missouri to Sacramento, California for a brief period of six months via the now legendary Pony Express, before it was replaced by a network of railroad, stage coaches, and other forms of local delivery along the way.  </p>
<p>Several of the proposed and adopted mail routes between St. Louis and the new state of California are delineated on the simple broadside <a href="/maps-of-trails-and-roads/1857-overland-mail-route-to-california#top">“Skeleton Map of the Overland Mail Route to California”</a>, attributed to John Butterfield (1801-1869) and presumably published by him in c. 1857. On it the southern route adopted by the US Post Office is marked in green and the proposed central Butterfield route is marked in red. The rejection of Butterfield’s route lost him a valuable postal contract. This map was circulated by those disgruntled about the decision of Postmaster Brown of Tennessee to opt for the southern route, which veered sharply south from St. Louis through Memphis and then on to the West Coast. As the explanations below the map point out in a thinly veiled accusation of Brown playing regional politics, the selected route was longer and through more inhospitable territory than that proposed by “John Butterfield and others (who were the lowest bidders).”  </p>
<p>As the Spanish Army before it, the American Army played an important role in the exploring, surveying, mapping, building, and protecting of the Western trails. Especially during the Mexican-American War, Civil War, and Indian wars, the cartographic role of the military was critical. During the Civil War, it was the growing network of roads that kept most of the West connected to the Union and the rest of it to the Confederacy. The <a href="/maps-of-trails-and-roads/1863-military-road-from-fort-walla#top">“Map of Military Road from Fort Walla Walla on the Columbia to Fort Benton on the Missouri…”</a>, by Captain John Mullan (1830-1909) and Edward Freyhold (<em>fl.</em> 1855-1879), among others, and published by Julius Bien &amp; Co. in New York in 1863, is a superb example of a map that served both the needs of the Union Army and civilians eager to go West. The road that this lithograph map documented was a vital link of 642 miles through Montana, Idaho, and Washington between the important Columbia and Missouri waterways. In addition to terrain, it shows related roads and trails, campsites, rapids, and the lands of Indian nations such as the Flathead, Blackfoot, Yakima, and Kootenay, among others, and associated battle grounds. Obviously, this map and numerous others like it were of value to all kinds of travelers beyond the military on this road and others like it.  </p>

<h3>The Cattle Trails</h3>
<p>Beginning with the Coronado <em>entrada</em> and certainly along <em>El Camino Real</em>, the Spanish brought millions of head of sheep, goats, swine, cattle, oxen, mules, burros, and horses into the American West over the course of almost 250 years. So too did those coming later from the East by the immigrant trails. Though the movement of livestock was nothing new by the coming of the great cattle drives and the trails they forged, which often followed older buffalo and other game migration routes as well as those of nomadic Indians such as the Comanche, they nevertheless form part of unique chapter, that of the “cowboys and Indians,” in the history of movement in America culture.  </p>
<p>The first of the cattle drives occurred before the American Civil War. At the time of the birth of the Texas republic in 1836, there already was a so-called beef trail to New Orleans. By 1840s and 1850s, herds of as many as 3,000 head mostly feral Spanish longhorn cattle were rounded up in eastern and central Texas and taken along what came to be called the Shawnee or Texas Trail across Indian Territory to markets in Arkansas and western Missouri.  </p>
<p>After the Civil War, Texas had a surplus of cattle and few local markets, but the United States needed expanded beef production to feed its growing population. This situation engendered the era of the great cattle drives over several major trails, usually bearing the names of their pioneers, northward to various new railheads in Kansas. The Goodnight-Loving Trail (of Charles Goodnight and Oliver Loving) reached from the Pecos River of New Mexico and West Texas to Dodge City in 1866; the Chisholm Trail (of Jesse Chisholm) followed in 1867 ultimately from the lower Rio Grande Valley through Fort Worth to Wichita and Abilene; the Western Trail came up from the hill country around San Antonio and merged with the Goodnight-Loving Trail at Fort Griffin in 1874; and in 1883, the Potter-Bacon Trail or Cutoff (of Jack Potter and Alfred T. Bacon) came from the Texas Panhandle and also merged with the Goodnight-Loving Trail at Fort Griffin. Above all, the presence of adequate fodder and water along the way were major determinants of the courses of these trails. By the 1890s, the end of open range and the progress of the railroads brought an end the trails that had seen millions of cattle to market in a little more than a quarter of a century.  </p>
<p>In 1875, the Kansas Pacific Railway Company, which was a part of the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe system, published <a href="/maps-of-trails-and-roads/1875-best-and-shortest-cattle#top">a now rare map entitled and promoting “The Best and Shortest Cattle Trail from Texas to Kansas City”</a>. It covered Texas and Oklahoma and parts of New Mexico, Colorado, and Kansas, showing the major Texan network of unnamed trails feeding into the prominently indicated “Ellsworth Cattle Trail” north to the Company’s loading pens at the rail head at Ellsworth, Kansas. Also marked to the west is “J.S. Chisum’s Trail” from Sumner, New Mexico north to the Los Animas/Fort Lyon, Colorado Company railhead.  While on this map this trail is named after John Chisum, a New Mexico rancher and friend of Billy the Kid of Lincoln County War fame and not the Texas rancher of Chisholm Trail fame, it is actually the Goodnight-Loving Trail. The major rivers along the way that were so important to the drives are clearly shown, though the Brazos and Colorado are somewhat arbitrarily drawn. Pointing to the western markets for Texas and New Mexico beef, the east-west railroad line through Kansas is conspicuously labeled the “Overland Cattle Trail for Colorado, Utah, and California.” While originally this map with its accompanying text was intended at least in part to advertise the way to Kansas Pacific Railway to the ranchers of Texas and New Mexico, today it helps viewers to understand better the routes, countryside, dangers, and economics of the great cattle drives.  </p>

<h3>Getting into the Maps</h3>
<p>Period maps are invaluable in elucidating the geographical factors and spatial relationships that helped determine the pattern of Western history in the nineteenth century. Beyond seeing these old maps as often quaint illustrations from the past from which they come, it is also common to treat them as artifacts of a bygone era of discovery, exploration, and exploitation and settlement. Such maps are indeed meaningful markers of human development and attainment, summarizing the scientific, technological, and intellectual strengths of an historical era and recording the political, economic, and social values of the times in which they were created.  </p>
<p>Maps are interpretations rather than copies of reality. As human constructions, they are social documents with individual points of view and per se useful tools for teaching about the past. In this regard, the study of maps can create a healthy attitude of inquiry and meaningful learning experiences. Simply put, they are rife with research topics for students to pursue.  </p>
<p>While all of the maps in this section provide representations of the geographical context of American westward expansion, maps <a href="/maps-of-trails-and-roads/1811-road-from-capital-of-new-spain#top">#1</a>, <a href="/maps-of-trails-and-roads/1779-map-of-the-province-of-new-mexico#top">#2</a>, <a href="/maps-of-trails-and-roads/1870-territory-of-montana#top">#5</a>, <a href="/maps-of-trails-and-roads/1898-gold-and-coal-fields#top">#7</a>, and <a href="/maps-of-trails-and-roads/1863-military-road-from-fort-walla#top">#9</a> are especially good exemplars. They quite straightforwardly show barrier mountains and their passes, rivers and their crossings, plains and deserts, and blazed trails and their connectors with the recommended campsites and settlements along them. Maps such as these also provide some insight into how the explorers and pioneers were influenced by natural obstacles to find ways across, through, and/or around them. They documented the physical geographical realities (e.g. Rocky Mountains) and myths (e.g. Great American Desert) of the American West for trappers, miners, emigrants, merchants, and soldiers alike.  </p>
<p>But these same maps and others such as <a href="/maps-of-trails-and-roads/1846-new-map-of-texas#top">#3</a>, <a href="/maps-of-trails-and-roads/1830-map-of-texas-with-parts#top">#4</a>, <a href="/maps-of-trails-and-roads/1859-route-from-kansas-city#top">#6</a>, <a href="/maps-of-trails-and-roads/1857-overland-mail-route-to-california#top">#8</a>, and <a href="/maps-of-trails-and-roads/1875-best-and-shortest-cattle#top">#10</a> also depicted the human political and economic geography of the West beyond the new settlements and towns. Although the specific boundaries of their domains commonly are missing, most obvious is the presence, if not precisely the threat, of the original inhabitants of the land—the Indians. Map <a href="/maps-of-trails-and-roads/1846-new-map-of-texas#top">#3</a>, for example, not only clearly establishes the diversity of their presence across the West, but also by implication makes it apparent that while they are on their lands, they are obstacles to westward movement and that much of those lands are up for grabs. With regard to the Indian presence, the previously mention Fremont-Preuss map of 1848 does much the same. Inherent in the idea of Manifest Destiny that these maps reflect is that, more than being a danger, the Indians are in the way of progress and expansion.  </p>
<p>Consequently, on some of the maps the Indians have already been removed from them.  The 1830 map <a href="/maps-of-trails-and-roads/1830-map-of-texas-with-parts#top">#4</a> portrays Texas beckoning to Anglo emigrants with its readily available lands in the already demarcated Austin and Dewitt colonies, yet clearly an integral part of Mexico. In 1857, map <a href="/maps-of-trails-and-roads/1857-overland-mail-route-to-california#top">#8</a> shows a United States to be connected coast-to-coast by a new overland mail route without any real depiction of geographical impediments, physical or human. On map <a href="/maps-of-trails-and-roads/1875-best-and-shortest-cattle#top">#10</a>, even though the reputedly major “Ellsworth Cattle Trail” crosses the bold marked “Indian Territory” its inhabitants no longer seem to be a problem for the great cattle drives from Texas to the Kansas railheads. And in 1898 on map <a href="/maps-of-trails-and-roads/1898-gold-and-coal-fields#top">#7</a>, neither US nor Canadian native peoples are referenced.  </p>
<p>The contemporary and implied political demarcations of the West correspondingly are to be found on several of the maps. On map <a href="/maps-of-trails-and-roads/1830-map-of-texas-with-parts#top">#4</a>, the future American state of Texas can be seen emerging out of its Mexican forerunner. Beyond an extended Texas, in 1846 map <a href="/maps-of-trails-and-roads/1846-new-map-of-texas#top">#3</a> begins to show Oregon and yet to come American California and Mexican Session. Map <a href="/maps-of-trails-and-roads/1870-territory-of-montana#top">#5</a> manifests the future states of Wyoming and Montana. Likewise the boundaries of Alaska, separating it from Canada and Russia, are marked definitively on map <a href="/maps-of-trails-and-roads/1898-gold-and-coal-fields#top">#7</a>.  </p>
<p>Along with location, place, relationships within places (human-environmental interaction), and regions, movement is one of the essential, unifying themes of modern geography, and perhaps the one interconnected closest with economic development. It follows then that maps directly related to movement should be demonstrative of economic development. Certainly, the maps considered in this section are. Maps <a href="/maps-of-trails-and-roads/1811-road-from-capital-of-new-spain#top">#1</a>, <a href="/maps-of-trails-and-roads/1779-map-of-the-province-of-new-mexico#top">#2</a>, <a href="/maps-of-trails-and-roads/1846-new-map-of-texas#top">#3</a>, and <a href="/maps-of-trails-and-roads/1870-territory-of-montana#top">#5</a> especially show not only the routes of emigration, but also of commerce. While much interest has already been paid by historians to the people who traveled these trails, far less has been given to the commodities regularly traveled on them from the times of the Indians and Spanish and Mexicans to the Americans well into the nineteenth century. These numerous goods and their exchange between the various groups had a telling impact on the advancing frontier and supported expansion and settlement. Many attention-grabbing research topics about these goods, their trade, and their impact exist for students to work on, with the period maps serving as some of their most important primary sources.  </p>
<p>The routes on maps such as <a href="/maps-of-trails-and-roads/1830-map-of-texas-with-parts#top">#4</a>, <a href="/maps-of-trails-and-roads/1859-route-from-kansas-city#top">#6</a>, and <a href="/maps-of-trails-and-roads/1898-gold-and-coal-fields#top">#7</a> typically point to locations of North America’s natural wealth—land for ranching, farming, and other uses and occasionally the mineral riches under it. These maps and others like them are excellent informants for gaining an understanding the land and gold and silver rushes of the West and their effects.  </p>
<p>Inherent in this and other cartography is the theme of the role of government and military in its development. As most of these maps easily reveal, the Spanish, Mexican, and American administrations commissioned and further encouraged the mapping of the West for purposes of exploration, expansion, exploitation, and regulation. Essential to this government cartographic activity was the military as pathfinders, engineers and surveyors, mapmakers, and defenders and overseers. Many students enjoy research topics on the military and are intrigued by its role in the history of cartography.  </p>
<p>And finally, a relatively simple example of scientific-technological advancement in cartographic reproduction can be derived from an examination of maps <a href="/maps-of-trails-and-roads/1779-map-of-the-province-of-new-mexico#top">#2</a>, <a href="/maps-of-trails-and-roads/1811-road-from-capital-of-new-spain#top">#1</a>, and <a href="/maps-of-trails-and-roads/1857-overland-mail-route-to-california#top">#8</a> in chronological order to note the progress made between hand drawn, engraved, and lithographed maps respectively. The hand drawn and copied map #1 reflects its rather limited secretive governmental administrative usage and non-commercial publication. At the time, what popular demand there was for maps such as this was minor and stifled by Spanish imperial policy. As the multifaceted demand for maps of the American West increased in the nineteenth century, they became more commercially viable and better reproduction technologies were called for to meet this demand. Thus, the more limiting metal plate engraving and printing on higher quality rag paper of map <a href="/maps-of-trails-and-roads/1779-map-of-the-province-of-new-mexico#top">#2</a> gave way to more mass produced lithograph maps (e.g. <a href="/maps-of-trails-and-roads/1846-new-map-of-texas#top">#3</a>) on cheaper wood pulp paper. And over the course of the century greater accuracy was required as well and realized through more and better mathematically based specific surveys by better trained military and civilian engineers and surveyors. Maps <a href="/maps-of-trails-and-roads/1811-road-from-capital-of-new-spain#top">#1</a>, <a href="/maps-of-trails-and-roads/1870-territory-of-montana#top">#5</a>, and <a href="/maps-of-trails-and-roads/1863-military-road-from-fort-walla#top">#9</a> are reflective of this growing reliability.  </p>

  return `<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The relationship between discovery/exploration and cartography is also hard to pin down. For many years, it was taken for granted in Western literature that explorers from Western Europe used maps both to reach the Americas and then to summarize what was found. This was the process accepted and often related in the nineteenth century by scholars like Justin Winsor (1886-9) and Henri Harrisse (1892); most twentieth-century historians, like Raleigh Skelton in <em>Explorers’ Maps: Chapters in the Cartographical Record of Geographical Discovery</em> (London, 1958), have followed this example, as indeed the title of Skelton’s book exemplifies.</p>
<p>However, in volume 3/1 of the authoritative <em>The History of Cartography</em> edited by David Woodward (Chicago, 2007), Felipe Fernández-Armesto attempted to modify this prevailing story. In the chapter called “Maps and Exploration in the Sixteenth and Early Seventeenth Centuries” he pointed out that although explorers like Christopher Columbus, John Cabot, and Ferdinand Magellan used maps before their departure in order roughly to judge the lie of the land, they neither used them in the course of their voyages, nor compiled them upon their voyage nor summarized them upon their return. Fernández-Armesto contended that this was in general true for sixteenth-century European navigators (though not for their successors in the seventeenth century).</p>
<p>While it is true that map-use of all kinds has been exaggerated by some authors, it would seem that the revisionist argument goes too far. In particular, it fails to take into account the activities of the Portuguese and Spanish navigation-schools at Lisbon and Seville respectively. Ironically enough, in the same volume of <em>The History of Cartography</em> are chapters by Maria Fernanda Alegria (and others) on the Portuguese <em>Armazém da Guiné</em> (Alegria 2007) and by Alison Sandman on the Spanish <em>Casa de la Contratacíon</em> (Sandman 2007). These chapters leave no doubt that in Lisbon and Seville were institutions devoted to equipping outgoing captains with maps, and to plotting the information that came back from their expeditions. Certainly their English rivals were in no doubt of the efficacy of this highly-organized pair of Iberian systems. In general, the argument that there was little contact between explorers and cartographers in the sixteenth century makes no sense. There is no doubt that European charts became steadily more comprehensive during this period; where could the chartmakers have obtained their information, if not by interrogating sea-captains and explorers? As Fernández-Armesto notes, the situation had changed by the seventeenth century, from which many of the examples in the present chapter are drawn; by then it would have been rare for an exploring expedition to leave without a specially-appointed cartographer, whose duty was to record the course of the voyage and to report back on it.</p>
<p>We shall assume, then, and innumerable maps confirm this point, that one of the results of the European exploration of the Americas was a steadily increasing understanding of the geography of the region. Of course, many of the groups living there also had their own traditions of mapping, wayfaring and spatial thinking, and sometimes their work—on materials like wood, animal skins and even sand—covered the vast areas over which they roamed and traded, to judge by archeological evidence (Woodward and Lewis 1998; Short 2009). While in many cases their geographical knowledge contributed to European maps, it was the latter which, especially after the widespread adoption of printing, proliferated in great numbers, comprehensively incorporating geographical information from a great variety of sources and establishing a standard for navigational accuracy. Thus it was European-style maps that came to provide the kind of detailed information that accompanied the European colonization and settlement of North America.</p>
<p>Medieval European world-maps had often covered huge areas, from the Atlantic islands eastwards to India and even Indo-China. If these maps lacked precision in detail, they nevertheless set out the main features of huge regions with which the mapmakers were vaguely acquainted. It was quite different in North America, where, after their arrival in what they would call the Bahama Islands, the Europeans had little sense of the shape of the huge landmass to the west of them. Because of the provisions of the Treaty of Tordesillas (1494), dividing the world into areas of Spanish and of Portuguese influence, it would be the Spaniards who led the first forays into North America, from their bases at first in the Caribbean Sea, and then in Central America. Spaniards in Mexico had found treasure almost beyond imagining, and they would find equally rich plunder when they ventured southwards, into the Inca lands. Spanish leaders therefore imagined that similar riches must lie to the north, which is why they ranged far up <a href="/european-maps-for-exploration/1541-nautical-chart-of-the-pacific-coast-of-mexico#top">the west coast of North America</a>, and into what is now <a href="/european-maps-for-exploration/1598-florida-and-the-apalachee-lands">the southeastern United States</a>.</p>
<p>For many years, the Spaniards succeeded in keeping the heart of the New World to themselves, in spite of sporadic attempts by French and English interlopers to establish themselves there. However, the envy of other European powers at the Spanish monopoly of the “treasure of the Indies” meant that sooner or later this monopoly would be broken, in spite of sometimes ferocious Spanish resistance. <a href="/european-maps-for-exploration/1612-virginia#top">Map 3</a> shows how an English colony was established in what was then called” Virginia” in the early seventeenth century, at a time when England and Spain were for a while at peace. French sailors and fishermen had long frequented areas further north, so that the French crown eventually made a permanent establishment on <a href="/european-maps-for-exploration/1612-new-france">the inhospitable banks of the Saint Lawrence River</a>, though like the English they also eventually succeeded in peopling islands in the Caribbean Sea, partly by importing enslaved Africans.</p>
<p>From their early bases on the Saint Lawrence River, French explorers and missionaries spent the rest of the seventeenth century slowly working out the cartography of the central part of continental North America, often incorporating information supplied by local people. Unlike most other Europeans, the French eventually formed a bi-racial (<em>métis</em>) society, and this no doubt contributed to their understanding and incorporation of local geographical knowledge. By the early eighteenth century they had established an empire which, identified by a line of isolated forts, stretched from the Saint Lawrence River, through the area of <a href="/european-maps-for-exploration/1672-jesuit-map-of-lake-superior#top">the Great Lakes</a>, and then down <a href="/european-maps-for-exploration/1703-new-voyages-in-northern-america#top">the Mississippi River</a> to its mouth on <a href="/european-maps-for-exploration/1688-globe-gore-of-eastern-north-america#top">the Gulf of Mexico</a>. This long area of cultural predominance hemmed in the English (and Dutch) colonies, clustered on the eastern seaboard; it also gave rise to a long series of cartographic skirmishes, as each side sought to expand its own area of jurisdiction (See, for example, Hayes 2007).</p>
<p>The east-west extent of North America remained a mystery to Europeans throughout this period. In 1728 Vitus Bering, Russian navigator (1681-1741), had identified the eastern end of the Russian Empire, but it was not at all clear how this related to <a href="/european-maps-for-exploration/1761-russian-voyages-in-the-pacific-northwest#top">northern North America</a>. Meanwhile the outcome of the American Revolutionary War (1776-1783) had been to unleash the energies of the inhabitants of the seaboard colonies, whose pioneers now poured westwards across the barrier of the Appalachian Mountains, <a href="/european-maps-for-exploration/1784-map-of-kentucky">sporadically mapping the huge land-area to the west as they went</a>.</p>
<p>It was not until the end of the eighteenth century that Europeans first understood the full extent of the east-west continent, first following the 1793 voyage of Andrew Mackenzie (1764-1820) (map 10), and then after the confirmatory expedition of Lewis and Clark (1804-6). By then the whole external shape of North America, apart from the northwestern Arctic regions, was well delineated from the Atlantic to Pacific coasts. The work of the nineteenth century, based on these early maps of exploration and discovery, would consist of filling in the vast land areas between those coasts.</p>

<h3>Spaniards in the Southwest</h3>
<p>Between 1528 and 1536, Alvar Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca (c. 1485-c. 1559) laid the foundations of Spanish exploration in North America, in the course of a huge looping journey beginning in Florida and ending almost on the Gulf of Mexico. Cabeza de Vaca brought back stories of populous towns and precious metals in what is now the southwestern United States, and this incited several more expeditions. In 1539 the first of these included the friar Marcos de Niza, who came back with tales of “seven cities,” roughly in what is now Arizona. This encouraged the formation of a new and larger expedition, led by Francisco Vasquez de Coronado (1510-1554), which left in 1540. Splitting into different groups, the explorers ranged from Arizona to Kansas, reaching the Grand Canyon and seeing great buffalo herds. But they did not find any great cities, and returned despondently to Mexico City in 1542.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Spaniards were also trying to push the boundaries of their knowledge northward by sea. In 1535 Hernando Cortés (1485-1547) himself led an expedition north into the Gulf of California; he only reached La Paz, but in 1539 he sent Francisco de Ulloa (d. 1540) on a further expedition, which succeeded in establishing the general shape of Baja California. The final substantial Spanish expedition at this time was led by Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo (1499-1543), who in 1542 sailed as far northwards as San Francisco. But none of these ventures was regarded as successful, for none found either easily exploitable riches or the presumed passage through the continent to the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>The maps generated by these expeditions were not numerous, and most have now been lost. But the information that they generated was largely summarized in <a href="/european-maps-for-exploration/1541-nautical-chart-of-the-pacific-coast-of-mexico#top">the work of Domingo del Castillo</a>. After that time the Spaniards sponsored no substantial expeditions for many years. The task of mapping the southwest passed to the Jesuit missionaries, who for nearly two centuries produced a large number of maps—of varying accuracy and sophistication—covering the regions of what would become known as the southwestern United States and northern Mexico (Cumming, Skelton, and Quinn 1972, 121). After the expulsion of the Jesuits, in the 1770s, the effort was taken up by Franciscans, as they mapped the progress of their coastal missions, which eventually stretched northwards as far as San Francisco.</p>

<h3>Spaniards in the Southeast</h3>
<p>The great expedition of Hernando de Soto (c. 1496-1542), partially incited by the reports of Cabeza de Vaca, started in Tampa Bay, where the Narvaez expedition (which included Cabeza de Vaca) had also disembarked on their adventure. But whereas Cabeza de Vaca spent most of his time in the southwest, de Soto covered about 4,000 miles in the southeast, wandering up as far as what is now Virginia, before making his way down to Alabama, then making his way back up to Tennessee. This astonishing odyssey, which was carried on by Luis de Moscovo after de Soto died in May 1542, eventually ended on the gulf coast of what is now Louisiana.</p>
<p>On the way, de Soto encountered a great variety of Indian nations and peoples, and carefully noted their characteristics. His expedition became notorious for its cruelty towards them, in his frantic but unavailing search for gold. De Soto’s men were in fact the first Europeans to see the Mississippi River, and indeed to sail upon it. Their wanderings were almost at once set down in a manuscript map drawn in 1544 by Alonso de Santa Cruz (c. 1500-1567), and preserved in the Archives of the Indies at Seville (Cumming, Skelton, and Quinn 1972, 121). Santa Cruz was a consummate mapmaker, and his pen-and-ink sketch offers an astonishing representation of the rivers and settlements of an immense area, hitherto entirely unknown to Europeans.</p>
<p>Over the ensuing years, many printed maps deriving from the work of Santa Cruz were published, notably by Abraham Ortelius (1527-1598). These maps tended progressively to simplify the original work of Santa Cruz, as indeed does <a href="/european-maps-for-exploration/1598-florida-and-the-apalachee-lands">map 2</a>, the work of a lawyer of the Low Countries. This was part of the widespread Habsburg Empire; it extended as well to Spain, and knowledge circulated freely within this huge area of Europe. Many of the Indian names and settlements noted by Santa Cruz have disappeared, though a few remain. The subtlety of the (often inaccurate) delineation of Santa Cruz has given way to a generalized version of the whole area. Particular emphasis is now given to the “Rio de S. Santo,” evidently meant as a delineation of the Mississippi River.</p>
<p>Manuscript maps of the newly-explored territories tended to be fuller and often more accurate than their printed derivatives. But the printed maps were generally much more influential, since they could be disseminated in hundreds of copies, and read by many people; this was a time when in many European countries literacy was increasing, the market for maps was booming (Carlton 2015). On the other hand, the manuscript maps often remained in the archives, generally unconsulted except by a few high officials.</p>

<h3>English Explorers on the Atlantic Coast</h3>
<p>The overwhelming presence and hostility of Spaniards in the Caribbean Sea and on the Gulf Coast in the sixteenth century discouraged English settlement there, but English explorers were undeterred in their voyages to the north, in areas beyond Spanish control. As early as 1500 they had established seasonal settlements on the coast of Newfoundland as a consequence of their activity in the cod-fishing industry. This activity had been dominated by Basques for some years, and indeed by local Mi’kmaqs before them.</p>
<p>In the early 1570s, the two voyages of Martin Frobisher (c. 1535-1594) threw some light on the area south of Greenland, as did the three voyages undertaken by John Davis (c. 1550-1605) in the 1580s. But the icy and rocky lands revealed by these voyages were clearly not suitable for English-style settlement, and the northwest passage, which would have opened access to China beyond the control of Spain, proved impossible to find. Early in the seventeenth century, the voyages of Henry Hudson (c. 1570-1611) and of William Baffin (c. 1584-1622) succeeded in identifying the outline of the vast Hudson Bay, but still the long-sought passage to the west could not be found.</p>
<p>In the latter years of the reign of Queen Elizabeth I (1558-1603), the English impulse towards colonial expansion, largely animated by envy of the Iberian examples, constantly grew. It resulted in 1587 in the short-lived establishment of a colony on Roanoke Island; much of the surrounding land was then mapped by the expedition’s surveyor, John White (c. 1540-1593) (Hulton 1984). These maps not only showed the general outline of land and sea, but also identified the local villages, do doubt with a mind to considering the expansion of the English settlement. Diverted by the threat of the Spanish Armada, the English did not succeed in sending the necessary resources to sustain this venture, which became known as “the lost colony.” However, in the early seventeenth century further expeditions were led by George Waymouth and Bartholomew Gosnold (1572-1607).</p>
<p>This powerful urge towards transatlantic exploration and settlement, encouraged by the emergence of persecuted religious minorities, came to a head after the conclusion of peace with Spain in 1604. In 1606 the Virginia Company was established, and in 1607 it sent an expedition which established a settlement at Jamestown, some way up the James River from the Atlantic Ocean. Captain John Smith (c. 1580-1631) produced <a href="/european-maps-for-exploration/1612-virginia#top">a well-known map of this colony</a>, and from this base the English slowly spread westwards during the years which followed.</p>

<h3>The French Presence on the Saint Lawrence River</h3>
<p>Like the English, the French had long been deterred from settling in the “Spanish” parts of the New World. Indeed, when in 1565 they attempted to establish themselves on the coast in what is now northern Florida, almost the entire colony was quickly put to the sword; the Spanish Crown could not tolerate the prospect of a French colony athwart the homeward route of their treasure-fleets (Cumming, Skelton, and Quinn 1972, 182-192). Many years before that, in the reign of king Francis I (1515-1547), there had been French attempts to establish a colony on the Saint Lawrence River. Jacques Cartier (1491-1557) led expeditions there in 1534, 1535 and 1541, and attempted to establish a settlement near present-day Québec. But the ferocity of the winters and the loss of many settlers to scurvy persuaded the French that this land was uninhabitable, and in 1543 the surviving settlers returned to France.</p>
<p>During much of the sixteenth century, from about 1560 to about 1598, the energies and resources that might otherwise have gone to French colonial expansion were diverted by the prolonged struggles known as “the wars of religion.” After 1598, and the establishment of a degree of toleration following the Edict of Nantes, King Henri IV (1589-1610) was able to think in terms of reviving French claims to a settlement in the valley of the Saint Lawrence River. An expedition there in 1600 failed, as did subsequent attempts to settle by the Bay of Fundy (1603-4 and 1605-7); not only was the climate harsh, but the promoters of these expeditions failed to realize the extent of continuing support that would be necessary for success.</p>
<p>However, in 1608 Samuel de Champlain (c. 1570-1635) led an expedition to Québec, near the deserted site of Stadacona, and this time the settlement succeeded in establishing itself. Champlain was not only an extremely venturesome explorer, but also a leader who knew very well how to keep his companions’ spirits up, and how to enable them to survive the savage winter weather on the Saint Lawrence River (Fisher 2008). He was in addition <a href="/european-maps-for-exploration/1612-new-france">an extraordinary cartographer</a>, who succeeded in compiling a map that showed virtually the whole of northeastern North America, as far west as Lake Huron and as far south as Boston Bay; no doubt Champlain made use of local knowledge, but his mapping skill came from his days working in France for the royal lodgings-service. In spite of various setbacks, the colony established by Champlain endured, and was the foundation for the extension of French power throughout the Great Lakes region.</p>

<h3>French Exploration along the Great Lakes and Mississippi Valley</h3>
<p>During the seventeenth century, mapping of the complex relationship of the Great Lakes to each other was largely the work of the Jesuits, a missionary order active in Canada from the early days of the renewed French presence. In their westward adventures they were often accompanied by traders like Jean Nicollet (c. 1599-1642), and by the hunter-trappers known as <em>coureurs des bois.</em> As a deeply literate and highly educated group, the Jesuits were well able to compile the maps which came out of these encounters; the course of studies which they all followed included instruction not only in mathematics but also in cartography.</p>
<p>By the later 1660s, they had compiled <a href="/european-maps-for-exploration/1672-jesuit-map-of-lake-superior#top">detailed maps which showed the Great Lakes to their full western extent (at what is now known as Duluth), and as far south as Green Bay, on Lake Michigan</a>. In 1673, the journey of fur trader Louis Jolliet (1645-c. 1700) and father Jacques Marquette (1637-1675) allowed the drawing of a map which showed the relationship of the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River, which was carefully delineated southwards as far as the Arkansas River. Eight years later, René-Robert Cavelier de La Salle (1643-1687) completed the work of Jolliet and Marquette by continuing down the Mississippi River as far as the Gulf of Mexico. The French now had a cartographic grasp of the whole interior of central North America, from Québec on the Saint Lawrence, in a great arc stretching down to the future site of New Orleans at the mouth of the Mississippi River.</p>
<p>There was for some years doubt among European explorers about precisely where the mouth of the great river lay, but once this was established, settlement came quickly. The francophone settlement at New Orleans was established in 1717, and in that same decade French settlers began farming what would become the breadbasket of their internal empire, alongside the Mississippi River where it is joined by the Illinois River. In the first half of the eighteenth century, it looked as if the French ring of settlements would one day effectively contain the westward expansion of the English settlements on the Atlantic coast. The consequent colonial rivalry would have disastrous results for those native peoples who were inevitably drawn into the competition.</p>

<h3>French Explorers Press Westward</h3>
<p>After the well-known exploits of Jolliet/Marquette and La Salle on the Mississippi River, lesser-known French explorers continued to press westward and eventually to reach the barrier of the Rocky Mountains. This whole region in the end became the home to societies marked by <em>métissage</em>, or the social and economic combination of Europeans, primarily Frenchmen, and Indians. These societies were organized differently and had different assumptions from the anglophone settlers with whom they eventually came into conflict.</p>
<p>Already in 1679 Daniel Greysolon, sieur du Lhut (c. 1639-1710) was active to the west of Lake Superior, where he eventually reached another lake, known as “Mille Lacs.” Between 1683 and 1692 Lahontan (Louis-Armand de Lom d’Arce de La Hontan) also travelled in this westerly country, emerging to publish his <a href="/european-maps-for-exploration/1703-new-voyages-in-northern-america#top"><em>Nouveaux voyages de Mr. le</em> <em>baron de Lahontan dans l’Amerique septentrionale</em></a> (La Haye, 1703), a work which was among the earliest to celebrate indigenous skills and achievement. The work of Lahontan, like that of his contemporary father Louis Hennepin (1626-c. 1705), has often been taken to task for its inaccuracy. But both authors seem to have described the confused process by which French explorers expanded their range into the Great Plains with reasonable precision.</p>
<p>Better documented is the work of Pierre Gaultier de Varennes, sieur de La Vérendrye (1685-1749) and his sons. They reached the Mandan territory by 1738, and by 1743 could be found near what is now Pierre, South Dakota. All this French activity depended ultimately on control of the Saint Lawrence River, the link back to France. When Québec fell under English control in 1759, and this loss was ratified by the peace of 1763, the link was broken, and the French empire in North America slowly withered on the vine. But French explorers had been responsible for most of the early mapping of central North America, and their social legacy long outlasted the collapse of France’s political control. This led to simmering conflicts when Anglo settlers encountered long-established francophone communities that had different ideas from them about land ownership, about slavery, and about religion.</p>

<h3>Russian Delineation of the Northwestern Coast</h3>
<p>By the middle of the eighteenth century, the great puzzle in the Europeans’ delineation of the coastline of North America was the outline of the northwestern coast. It was the Russians who provided the first part of the answer, when in the 1740s Vitus Bering and Aleksei Chirikov (1703-1748) plotted the coast of far eastern Russia. <a href="/european-maps-for-exploration/1761-russian-voyages-in-the-pacific-northwest#top">Their maps</a> also showed some features of the land to the east of this, but did not give any detail. During the rest of the century, a sequence of Russian explorers slowly pushed the frontier of their geographical knowledge southwards, until by 1800 the Russians had explored and partly settled what we now know as Alaska, and had pushed their investigation down almost to San Francisco (David 1988-97).</p>
<p>Spanish authorities in California heard of these developments, and in the 1770s sent an expedition north under Juan José Pérez Hernández (c. 1725-1775). This expedition reached as far north as the Haida Gwaii, (more commonly known as the Queen Charlotte Islands or “the Charlottes” from 1787 to 2010), but did not quite advance to the edge of Russian settlement. Its pilot, José de Cañizares, drew a remarkable map of the coast north from Monterey to the vicinity of Vancouver Island. This was the first European map to delineate the coast from actual exploration, but did not succeed in linking up with Russian maps.</p>
<p>The linking of the two mapping systems was the achievement of the British navigator James Cook (1728-1779), whose 1778 expedition sailed northward from Vancouver Island, eventually reaching the Bering Strait, and assiduously charting the coastline on the way (David, 1988-97). There now remained only the delineation of the extremely complex route from Baffin Bay, on the Atlantic side, to the Beaufort Sea, on the Pacific side, across the top of North America. But the technically very demanding mapping of this set of islands and coastline would have to wait until the early twentieth century. In our day this route has become much more accessible, thanks to melting of the sea ice, the result of global warming in this region.</p>

<h3>Filling in Cartographic Knowledge of the Interior</h3>
<p>Towards the end of the eighteenth century, various parts of interior North America had been mapped by the European powers, initially along waterways. The Spaniards had mapped the long valley of the Rio Grande, as well as the coastal strip north of the Gulf of Mexico. French cartographers had delineated the line of the Saint Lawrence, Great Lakes and the Mississippi River, while the English had mapped large parts of the land between the Appalachian Mountains and the Atlantic ocean. After 1783, it was the turn of the infant United States to take up this internal mapping.</p>
<p>One of the causes of the Revolutionary War had been the opposition of the British government to Euro-American settlement across the barrier of the Appalachian Mountains, into lands long inhabited by peoples whose claims were often protected by treaties with European powers. Such agreements were ignored by those daring settlers who crossed them in the 1760s and 1770s. They sometimes passed through the Cumberland Gap, one of the few relatively easy passages; sometimes, too, they came into conflict with French traders, who operated increasingly often in the valley of the Ohio River. This illegal activity effectively became legal after 1783, and greatly increased. <a href="/european-maps-for-exploration/1784-map-of-kentucky">Early colonists like John Filson (c. 1747-1788) settled and mapped much of Kentucky</a>, giving rise in the process to the legend of Daniel Boone (1734-1820). One of the folk-heroes of the United States, he became largely famous for his many skirmishes with the Shawnee. Like Filson, Jefferson and indeed many other leaders of the new nation, he was also a surveyor; the movement of Euro-Americans across the Appalachian Mountains gave rise to many, often disparate, maps.</p>
<p>At the national level, the adoption of the Land Ordinance of 1785 led to the establishment of the township-and-range system, which eventually covered most of the United States in a grid of six-mile-square units, bringing some order to the generally tumultuous process of expansion. Beginning with the seven ranges to the west of the River Ohio, it slowly crept across the land, only reaching some western areas in the twentieth century. It did offer an excellent way of correcting all previous maps in such areas as the exact delineation of the coasts of Lake Michigan, which had until that time greatly fluctuated on European maps.</p>
<p>The epic 1805-1806 journey of Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, <a href="/european-maps-for-exploration/1801-mackenzies-northern-voyages#top">though not the first recorded one to traverse the continent to the Pacific</a>, nevertheless established the exact extent of the territory claimed by the new nation, and returned with a great wealth of newly-drawn maps, as well as extensive natural history collections. Almost at once, John Jacob Astor’s Pacific Fur Company pushed through to the mouth of the Columbia, establishing the South Pass of the Rocky Mountains, which before long would become the gateway to the West for thousands of immigrants from the East.</p>
<p>After this, a sequence of groups played their part in establishing the geography of the huge new area claimed, and partially controlled, by the United States: The “mountain men” in the 1820s, the emigrants of the late 1830s, and the military men of the 1840s, like Lieutenant John Charles Frémont (1813-1890) and Lieutenant William H. Emory (1811-1857). Much new and precise geographical information came from the railroad surveys of the 1850s, and it was then left to government agencies like the Interior Department to add the finishing details, communicating them in ways that would encourage settlement; this communication often took the form of maps. By the end of the nineteenth century, the era of exploration and discovery, as well as the period during which the advancing frontier could be traced, was over, and a period of relative domesticity ensued.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>From beginning to end, the process of European exploration of North America had been accompanied by maps. Many were drawn in consultation with members of the indigenous peoples, bringing these insights into harmony with European concepts of map-formation. Some of these maps remained manuscript, most often then consulted only by political and military leaders. Others, though, were printed, at first only back in Europe, and these printed maps played a central role in letting interested European readers know about the huge movements of peoples that were taking place across the Atlantic. Needless to say, they were also powerful agents of propaganda drawing a variety of European migrants across the ocean, sometimes to regions that had been seriously misrepresented in both text and maps. After the period of most intense movement of peoples, maps continued to play a central role in facilitating understanding of a vast area for travelers, who might be discovering whole regions for the first time. For many years, commercially-produced road-maps filled this need. With the generalized use of remote imaging, this function is now fulfilled for many people by use of Google Earth, which enables the user to fly over huge areas, and then to achieve a detailed representation that would have astonished those cartographers who had laboriously charted the process of European expansion into a disputed land.</p>

<h3>Further Reading</h3>
<p>Some books make the explicit connection between exploration and mapping; among the best of these are R.A. Skelton, Explorers’ Maps and Peter Whitfield, New Found Lands: Maps in the History of Exploration. Other works simply refer to maps in the course of tracing the history of exploration and discovery. For maritime history in medieval and early modern Europe, Michel Mollat du Jourdin and Monique de La Roncière’s Sea Charts of the Early Explorers, translated from the French, offers a well-illustrated account of the way in which European navigators slowly achieved a knowledge of the wider world.</p>
<p>For North America, two uniform volumes offer an unrivalled account of exploration with original texts and contemporary maps : W.P. Cumming, R.A. Skelton and D.B. Quinn, The Discovery of North America and W.P. Cumming, S. Hiller, D.B. Quinn and Glyndwr Williams, The Exploration of North America 1630-1776; although forty years old, these volumes have never been replaced. Some more recent work adopts a more purely cartographic approach; see here Derek Hayes, America Discovered: A Historical Atlas of North American Exploration and Raymonde Litalien, Jean-François Palomino and Denis Vaugeois, Mapping a Continent, the latter being particularly strong on the French contribution.</p>
<p>Finally, two works effectively combine text, contemporary maps and specially-drawn recent maps. William Goetzmann and Glyndwr Williams, The Atlas of North American Exploration, takes up an account of the way in which the various European cartographers came to an understanding of the continent, while The Oxford Companion to World Exploration provides a great variety of maps to explain the process of European discovery.</p>

  return `<p>In March 1775, William Mylne packed his bags and headed north. A Scottish engineer whose bridges had a bad habit of falling down, Mylne tried to start over as a farmer in Georgia only to fail at that as well. Hoping for better opportunities in a northern city, Mylne struck out across South Carolina on horseback. Coming to a crossroads, the rider consulted a map to decide which road to take.</p>
<p>“I had rode about twenty miles when the road parted in two, I took out a map I had of this province to examine which to take, the crumpling of the paper startled the horse, who leaped out fairly below me. After I got up I saw him galloping through the woods; at a mile’s distance he came out again to the road, a traveller catched him and brought him back. My saddle bags in his career had come of[f], I now thought I should be obliged to return as the few shirts I had were there. I went into the woods, tracing the tract he had taken as near as I could, by the greatest good fortune after an hours search I found them. I now proceeded on my journey to Georgetown, which I reached in two days and a half, most of the land all the way very indifferent, being pine barren except in some places where there were indigo plantations.” (Mylne, 61)</p>
<p>Mylne’s sad but amusing anecdote belongs near the beginning of a long strain of American humor based on travelers getting lost in strange places while struggling to follow a map. It also highlights how the eighteenth century witnessed a transition in the ways Europeans made, used, and thought about maps of North America. Mylne’s journey revealed the humor involved in a culture coming to grips with the distance between the imagined landscapes of maps and the lived reality of travel in late colonial America. But the transition was more than just a funny story. As Anglo-Americans changed the way they related maps to movement, they set the stage for centuries of American mapping to come.</p>
<p>The eighteenth century marked several important shifts in mapmaking and map use in England and its American colonies. Earlier views of cartographic history have marked this century as the era when science began its triumph over art in the production of maps in a perfect symbol for the larger Age of Reason and Enlightenment. The fanciful decorations of early modern maps seemingly vanished as mapmakers increasingly became “cartographers,” that is, devotees of the idea that a map’s value and beauty lay in its “objective” depiction of physical and human geography in as scientifically “accurate” a manner as possible, or according to the “Newest and most exact Observations,” as one mapmaker put it (Herman Moll, below). More recently, as scholars of the Enlightenment period have come to identify not a single “Age of Reason” descending like a curtain across the minds of Europeans, they have likewise come to revise their view of Enlightenment maps. Maps still can be seen as exemplars of Enlightenment, but the Enlightenment is not what it used to be. Recent studies have begun to emphasize multiple Enlightenments, loosely held together by new ideals of truth that crossed national (and sometimes cultural, racial, and gendered) borders but that were always everywhere conditioned by local and regional systems of belief. (Harley, 191; Edney, 1999, 165-6; Withers, 1999).</p>
${validate_component(Image, "Image").$$render($$result, { index: "1" }, {}, {})}
<p>Eighteenth-century maps were central to these Enlightenment contests and thus reflect the age that produced them. In this new idea of Enlightenments, the seemingly blank and plain maps of the 1700s come alive with new meanings. In this new light, the maps reemerge as places of contest and struggle. Across their seemingly plain surfaces, one can trace contests of authority and definition, of legitimation and denial. Indeed, plainness itself was a conscious rhetorical move in service of ideological and political aims rather than a self-evident necessity. (Edney 1999, 169) In their multiple and not even internally consistent approaches to the idea of geographic “truth,” these Enlightenment maps represent a distinct phase within the larger history of Euro-American mapmaking quite apart from the earlier so-called “artistic” maps of the early modern period and the later, professionalized “scientific” cartography of the 1800s. (Edney, 1999, 166)</p>
<p>Maps of North America are a particularly good source to study the tensions of Enlightenment mapping. While the distance between ideal and reality was always great in mapmaking, the American gap was perhaps larger than most. Even in Europe, Europeans struggled with the ongoing delays between the development of new ideals of “truth” in mapmaking and the techniques of measuring the earth required to reach those ideals. But in Europe and elsewhere, these mapmakers managed to find new forms of data gathering better suited to the emerging politics of the idealized Enlightenment map, supplementing traditional narrative accounts of travel and exploration with the techniques of triangulation on land and astronomical observation at sea and combined these with the constant corroboration of written sources. (Edney, 1999) They did this in France, in Russia, in China, and in the Pacific bringing a new idea of mapmaking to the problems of mapping the world (Mapp, 2011, 166-201).</p>
<p>In North America, however, these new techniques were not easily applied, leaving these new ideals of mapmaking to rely on the same old narratives of travelers that they had for centuries. In a continent where trained surveyors were few and far between, it is unsurprising that, aside from coastal surveys, mapmakers relied heavily on the traditional sources of geographic information—travel accounts from the various inhabitants of the continent. The tension between mapmakers’ ambitions and the reality of mapping in British North America is what makes eighteenth-century American maps so interesting. Numerous voices and conceptions of geography competed for representation on printed maps. Each mapmaker had to reconcile the personalized, subjective movement-based origins of their information with the Enlightenment mandate to present a more universalized, depersonalized and therefore supposedly “accurate” map of the continent. Each mapmaker and their cadre of artists of engravers had to privilege certain kinds of information and discard others without any defined guidelines. Every map of North America in the eighteenth century was therefore an experiment and an improvisation. The eighteenth century was not a simple journey from crude to refined. It was instead an era in which new conceptions of what a map should be interacted and conflicted with the realities of what a map could be. And out of those tensions rose new ways in which mapmakers and their audiences interacted through the medium of the map.</p>
<p>Some interesting features of eighteenth-century maps stand out due to the unique tensions of the era. One is the persistence of human movement within the features of the map. Despite map printers’ desire to market their maps as impersonal, universal, and “accurate,” the very real human motions that generated the mapmakers’ main archive of information still presented themselves throughout the era. Likely in response, mapmakers developed strategies to deflect the readers’ attention away from this aspect of the map’s creation, in particular encouraging readers to quickly move past the facts of the map’s creation and to instead indulge in the visual pleasures of imagining travel through North America. This coaching by mapmakers in turn helped spur the map-reading public to use their imaginations to envision movements bigger than those of individual travelers and to see whole processes of history unfolding across their lines. In other words, through various rhetorical and design strategies, eighteenth-century mapmakers helped train their audiences to see maps not as the result of past travels, but as tools of the reader’s vision to encourage future movements, both imagined and real. It was a visual fiction that, at least in the case of poor William Mylne, did not always match up to reality, but that nonetheless represents a powerful-yet-underexplored feature of eighteenth-century mapmaking.</p>
<p>Published maps were not always so disconnected from the human movements that informed them. In the seventeenth century, maps of individual travel were printed and received wide circulation; the singularity of the journey was not a liability in an age of exploration. These maps of the Americas, particularly larger-scale regional maps, tended to make very clear the relationship between the printed map and individual movement. In an age of early settlement and colonization, the individual journey was often the fastest path to new geographic information. European mapmakers relied on singular journeys for their maps, and atlases of the Americas and did very little to disguise the nature of their sources. These maps tended to focus on the individual traveler and highlighted the limitations of such a singular view of the landscape. John Smith’s map of the Chesapeake serves as an example: Smith placed himself prominently in the map and marked with little crosses the limits of his own journeys, highlighting to the map’s audience that they were seeing and hearing only what Smith saw and heard: some of it firsthand, some through verbal reports, but no more or less than Smith himself had encountered.</p>
<p>John Lederer’s 1672 A Map of the Territory of Virginia likewise offers another excellent example of the published personal map of discovery. The geography of this map could in no way be separated from the individual’s particular experiences. A young, German scholar, Lederer undertook a long journey southwest from the colony of Virginia in 1670. The map’s main purpose was to provide readers with a visual itinerary of Lederer’s trip. Although the dotted lines used to mark Lederer’s movements were not the most visually striking image on the map, they nonetheless provided the map with its overall shape. Rivers and mountains frame the trail and the map’s lettering aligns itself to Lederer’s route. The map offers almost no information beyond what Lederer experienced personally. In all, the map provided a fairly accurate record of Lederer’s experience but not the topography, showing the southern Piedmont as a landscape glimpsed only along the corridors Lederer traveled. Given the mapmaker’s great difficulty translating Native geographic knowledge into European terms, it is unsurprising that the map was as limited as it was. (Hollis, 158-163)</p>
${validate_component(Image, "Image").$$render($$result, { index: "2" }, {}, {})}
<p>The path shaped the entire map. Centered on Lederer’s route, the map became blank at the edges, save for the known parts of Virginia in the lower right-hand corner. The Appalachian Mountains form a horizon beyond which lay nothing but emptiness (filled with the compass rose and legend). Eastern Carolina hardly appeared at all, despite being well known since at least the late-1500s maps of John White. But Lederer did not travel there, so the region did not appear on the map. As he did in his text, Lederer provides a hint of the massive (and fictional) Lake Ushury in the map’s upper left. Lederer claimed he could see the other side of the lake, but thought not to include that edge in his map, teasing its audience with the prospect of a vast inland waterway. The effect is to reinforce the idea that these were landscape features only glimpsed by a single traveler.</p>
<p>Lederer’s map thus reveals the itinerant nature of its production. Much like following a blazed trail, the traveler could only record his journey by following the precise order of the landmarks. To leave one out would be to get hopelessly lost. Rivers, lakes, villages—these could only be mapped as points along a path, not as defined expanses of territory. Anything that the map attempted to record beyond the traveler’s line of sight was based on verbal or other accounts of landscape lodged in the memories of other (primarily Native American) informants and occasionally drawn or retold to the mapmaker. Mostly these involved the landscape impressions and knowledge of Native travelers, whose concepts of landscape never easily fit with European ones and allowed only rudimentary “pidgin” cartographies which easily bore the marks of their creation. (Belyea, 140; Paulett, 23)</p>
<p>Traditionally, historians of cartography have consigned maps such as Lederer’s to a pre-modern era that favored description and personal experience over accurate measurement (Cumming, 1-2). But, this does not mean Lederer’s map was crude. It conveyed a richness of movement and the experience of a traveler. It did not measure distances accurately and it invented landscape features. Existing at the intersection of Lederer’s travel narrative and landscape portraiture, the map worked as something of a panorama—a moving picture through which the reader could better visualize Lederer’s experience.</p>
<p>Such maps of movement remained important well into the eighteenth century. Indeed, their frequency likely increased as European travelers became more and more common across the face of North America, driven by the expansion of European colonization in the Americas. (Edney 1999, 176). In particular, the trade between Indians and Europeans increased as the century wore on, creating new travelers and new sources of geographic information. The Indian trade provided mapmakers access to large reserves of human knowledge created by the movement of private traders, public agents, and untold thousands of Indian diplomats and informants. As France and Great Britain in particular jostled with each other for claims over eastern North America, they relied on the complex webs of personal, official, and economic relationships provided by the exchange of European manufactured goods for Native manufactured deerskins. Navigating this region, marked by the complex politics of Native America, proved tricky at all times. Traders thus relied on a set sequence of paths and places in order to best ensure safe passage and predictable futures. The sequence of places was the crucial safeguard against getting lost along the way. (Paulett, 2-4)</p>
<p>The individual map of movement continued as a form through the eighteenth century but surviving examples are rare. A reprinted edition of George Hunter’s 1730 map of his travel to the Cherokees reveals the changing relationship between movement, mapping, and the map-reading public. Hunter was a surveyor who accompanied Sir Alexander Cumming on a diplomatic mission to enhance South Carolina’s (and Cumming’s own) standing among the Cherokees while at the same time diminishing the influence of the Virginia colony in that region. The map shows the party’s route along South Carolina’s primary trading path. The path followed the Santee River, across the headwaters of the Savannah River, and across the mountains to the Overhills Cherokees of present-day eastern Tennessee. Along the way, Hunter made note of village names and recorded some information about more distant areas (likely gained from traders). (Cumming, 228)</p>
<p>Hunter’s map was typical of the traveler’s sense of geography, in which the physical and human geography of South Carolina were important only as far as they aligned with the trading paths. The creeks running into the Santee River are presented as slashes perpendicular to the river, recorded in the order in which the traveler encountered them. Hunter marked distance with verbal notes, creating an itinerary of places between the starting point and the end point but based on impression more than precise measurement. In many ways, Hunter’s map functioned like a modern subway system map where stations are arranged in straight lines so that the rider knows which station will come next. The sequence of places mattered a great deal, but the topography beyond the path was little known. (Most of Hunter’s notes about areas beyond the path come from the vague “reports” he cites in the map’s legends.) To lose the path was therefore to risk getting lost in a large region. For this reason, Hunter’s “Journal of the Road” in the lower left exactly reproduces the same sequence of places going up to the Cherokees as returning. To find one’s way back to Charleston, one simply had to retrace one’s steps. Closer analysis of this map would no doubt reveal even more about the experience of travel in colonial America. The travelers’ experience also explains why their accounts of the interior resulted in a similar linearity when they were included on more “professional” and “scientific” maps of the 1700s.</p>
<p>But while the frequency of such mapping episodes increased, the printed map of travel was becoming less favored in printing offices. Unlike Lederer’s map which was widely printed in its original form and widely copied by other, eighteenth-century maps of travel like Hunter’s survived mostly as manuscripts in various archives. Hunter’s map, for example, was not publicly available until this print of the original manuscript was made available in 1917. This object therefore reveals not just the experience of travel but of how eighteenth-century Anglo-American map practices were increasing the distance between the individual map of travel and the printed map of popular consumption. Maps such as Hunter’s were still the most common and immediate source for geographic information about the American interior. However, published maps were increasingly taking ideological and formal steps to diminish the idea of movement within their gridlines. Surveyors like Hunter recognized this new relationship, as well, marking significant crossroads with surveyor’s notes on longitude and latitude. The traveler was learning to see the landscape with an eye towards compilation and collation rather than description.</p>
${validate_component(Image, "Image").$$render($$result, { index: "3" }, {}, {})}
<p>The map therefore reveals that “Enlightenment” mapmaking was more an exercise in treating the same information differently rather than a shift in the techniques of mapmaking. The eighteenth century increasingly emphasized not just the pursuit of knowledge but emphasized the management and control of knowledge. Increasingly, the printed maps of America came not from individual travelers but from the shops of self-appointed “expert” compilers. Here emerged the familiar form of the eighteenth-century map—the increasingly “plain” chart that was every bit as dependent on complex human interactions as earlier maps but that nonetheless tried to mask this dependence for numerous intellectual, political, and economic reasons. Rather than recognize their maps as the product of individuals’ limited range of vision, mapmakers emphasized the accuracy and collaborative nature of their maps. By assuring their audiences of the complete accuracy of their works, mapmakers could then use their maps in new ways: as settings in which European viewers could imagine the marches of historical figures and across which Europeans could plan future movements. The human movements that produced these maps (still completely necessary) were hidden from view. The result was a growing culture of map reading, where Anglo-American audiences could imagine themselves gazing from above at all manner of important events. As Britain increasingly sought to claim and control its American possessions, its citizens found comfort in this power of maps to impart a sense of order and control. (Nobles, 13-19)</p>
<p>Herman Moll, perhaps most prominent among early eighteenth-century British mapmakers, reveals the sleights of hand being invented to separate the map from the supposedly unreliable travel accounts that were the map’s main sources of information. His 1720 A New Map of the North Parts of America claimed by France was an exercise in the increasingly conscious political decisions that underlay supposedly disinterested maps. Moll used his map to advocate his own personal point of view and made no efforts to hide his authorship. He wanted Britain to take greater interest in its American colonies and confronted them with nightmare images of invading Frenchmen to accomplish this task. But he relied on the supposed accuracy of his map to sell his point. Accuracy was becoming a political stance within British colonial politics and became a rhetorical tool long before accurate measurement became reality (Edney 2004, 324-325; Edney 2011, 277-278).</p>
<p>Key to this posture of accuracy was managing the unruly interplay of source material, mapmaker, and audience. Here on view are the unsteady and negotiable conflicts in this new age of Enlightenment managerial mapmaking. Moll was clear and careful to name his sources right under the map’s title. “A Great part of this Map,” he informed his readers, “is taken from ye Original Draughts of Mr. Blackmore, the Ingenious Mr. [Richard] Berisford now Residing in Carolina, Capt. [Thomas] Nairn and others never before Publish’d, the South West Part of Louisiana is done after a French Map Publish’d at Paris in 1718.” Moll claimed the authority of numerous observations preferred by an audience that by 1720 was increasingly trusting the repeated experimentation of the Scientific Revolution and its culture of public witnessing over the older claims to personal authority that marked early modern Europe. (Jacob and Stewart, 89-92) By listing these men by name, Moll could assure his readers that the map was “laid Down according to the Newest and Most Exact Observations By H. Moll Geographer.” Moll, of course, did not have any special knowledge. His major sources of information were the same Indian trading networks that produced itinerary maps like Hunter’s and his map thus included the linear trade geography even as it reached for a claim to accuracy beyond the capabilities of an individual observer. (Paulett, 14-17, 29-31)</p>
<p>What Moll had instead of special knowledge was a new idea emerging in the eighteenth-century—the authority of “reasoned judgment” by which self-appointed individuals could claim and tame the supposedly base and untrustworthy information coming from the mouths and pens of Indians, traders, and agent. Eighteenth-century scientists based their authority in their ability to see beyond variable individual observations and to discover the “truth” of underlying forms. The educated scientist took myriad individual observations, ruminated on them, exercised their “reason” to discern between truth and dangerous imagination, and then hired artisans to translate their authoritative vision into a printed product. (Daston and Gallison, 58-60, 97-98, 223-227). For a mapmaker such as Moll, this idea of trained judgment meant he could list his sources but assure his readers that the observations were his and his alone.</p>
${validate_component(Image, "Image").$$render($$result, { index: "4" }, {}, {})}
<p>Moll’s map, however, does not demonstrate the confidence of a reasoned observer. In fact, it is marked by deflection and distraction in the way that it encourages the reader to quickly turn away from the method of its creation and to imagine instead the ways in which the reader might use the map. Turning the subjective impressions of American informants into a seemingly concrete and stable image of the continent in the map’s title, Moll used the legends and notations on his map to present his readers with images of invading Frenchmen and heroic Englishmen as a means of helping plan the future movement of English settlers across the continent. But, not trusting his readers fully, Moll prominently placed helpful instructions to assist his readers in the proper interpretation of the map’s information:</p>
<p>“NB The French Dominions are inserted on purpose, that those Noblemen, Gentlemen, Merchants &amp;c. who are interested in our Plantations in those Parts, may observe whether they agree with their Proprieties, or do not justly deserve ye Name of Incroachments; and this the more to be observed, because they do thereby Comprehend within their Limits ye Cherakeys and Iroquois, by much ye most powerfull of all ye Neighbouring Indian Nations, the old Friends and Allies of the English, who ever esteemed them to be the Bulwark and Security of all their Plantations in North America.” (Moll, 1720)</p>
<p>Twice, Moll insisted that looking at his map was the same as “observing” the actual American landmass and that his map provided at one glance a full view of the whole populated continent, filled with English settlements, French “incroachments,” and Native peoples.</p>
<p>Moll then drew a literal line (the Tropic of Cancer) straight from the map title all the way to the lower right corner to further instruct his readers in the map’s use. Ostensibly explaining to his readers how to correct for the Mercator projection’s distortion of northern distances, he made sure to demonstrate the issue with the example of planning an overland march from New York City to a Susquehanna fort in western Pennsylvania, conveniently located on the supposed boundary between French and English claims. The imagination of the compiler was to be mistrusted and swept away with reason. However, Moll’s exhortations to his readers to use their imagination reveals an interesting new role for maps in the eighteenth century. This was more than envisioning the travels of someone like Lederer; this was encouraging readers to imagine future travels and future plans with the assistance of the map.</p>
<p>The presentation of movement and the relationship between mapmaker and audience continued to be informed by the political context of individual mapmakers, despite their claims to supposedly disinterested authority. A side-by-side comparison of two maps created at the same time using almost identical sources reveals how the shape of the map was still an ongoing experiment throughout the 1700s. By the mid-eighteenth century, mapmakers were taking advantage of the increasing number of information options to selectively create their maps and the selection is clear on comparison of Lewis Evans’s 1755 A General Map of the Middle British Colonies in America and Joshua Fry and Peter Jefferson’s A Map of the Inhabited Part of Virginia from the same year. Despite their different titles, both maps show a similar stretch of territory at a similar scale, particularly in regards to the Ohio Valley. The overlap is no accident and in fact the three mapmakers exchanged information with each other. The differences in the two maps’ appearances therefore resulted not from access to different information but in the political purposes behind them. Both Pennsylvania (Evans’s home) and Virginia (Fry and Jefferson’s) were extremely interested in the Ohio Valley in the 1750s, as Pennsylvania and Virginia waged a furious diplomatic battle for the alliance of the Ohio Valley Indians, since Indian sales were preferred by the British crown as the surest method of transferring land rights from Indians to Europeans.</p>
<p>The two maps look very different, reflecting the political strategies of the respective colonies. Evans’s map details a dense network of roads, rivers, and villages west of the Allegheny Mountains, carefully drawn and shaded across the middle of the map. Fry and Jefferson, however, depict only thin strings of mountains and a virtually empty Ohio Valley. The contrast between the Evans and Fry-Jefferson maps reveals that eighteenth-century maps were more than a contest between “crude” and “accurate” information, or even between European and non-European ideas of mapmaking. While these were all components of the complex production of maps, the cartographic contest of 1755 also reveals that maps were frequently a contest of different kinds of European mapmaking traditions, each source of information either consciously or unconsciously selected to suit the political interests of the mapmakers.</p>
<p>Printed in Pennsylvania (one of the earliest American-printed maps), Evans’s map reflected the local political interest. While deeply mistrustful of traders’ accounts, Evans nonetheless went to great lengths to present their movements as part of his map. The General Map relied heavily on the information of traders in order to secure that colony’s rights to the Ohio Valley. Pennsylvania had since its founding maintained a strong connection to the Indians of Susquehannah Valley, the Lenni Lanape (Delawares) and Shawnees in particular. As those groups migrated westward in the early 1700s, Pennsylvania believed it had the inside track to claiming potentially valuable Ohio lands through the mechanism of Indian trade and diplomacy.</p>
${validate_component(Image, "Image").$$render($$result, { index: "5" }, {}, {})}
<p>Evans apparently felt the need to publish a map of movement that could nonetheless meet the new standards of “truth-in-nature” that gave maps their scientific authority in the 1700s. Printed in America rather than in London, Evans perhaps felt freer to experiment with form and content and this map, famous as it is, deserves much closer investigation as a Tristam Shandy-like experiment in defining what a map could be before anyone really knew what a “map” was. Evans, considering himself a man of science, mistrusted traders’ accounts but relied on them nonetheless. In the eighteenth century, most genteel observers cast a jaundiced eye at the political motivations of lower classes, believing them incapable of acting out of anything beyond crass selfishness (Wood, 104-106). Traders were in particular seen as suspicious in the 1700s because of their decision to live so much of their lives among Indians. Their geographic reports were likewise mistrusted (somewhat ironically) because traders were the only Europeans to see most of the Ohio Valley firsthand and they had an obvious motivation to shape those reports to suit their own self-interest. (Klinefelter, 41) Traders’ words, doubly tarnished by low births and Indian associations, would have come under heavy scrutiny.</p>
<p>Forced to rely on “untrustworthy” traders, Evans did his best to correct the traders’ impressions of distances across the Allegheny Mountains. (Klinefelter, 44-45). Regardless of their political motivations, traders likely did tend to distort mileages because travelers through mountainous terrain could only describe the experience of distance rather than the precise measurement of distance (and some mountainous roads clearly felt longer than flatter roads of a similar distance). But Evans, in his desire to draw links between Philadelphia and the banks of the Ohio River, needed to emphasize trader impressions of those areas west of the mountains since the human connections of the trade were key to Pennsylvania’s land claims. Evans’s own survey trips required diplomatic authorization to travel through Indian lands and he required verbal descriptions (and probably visual descriptions) from traders as to what lay beyond the range of his own surveys.</p>
<p>The result was an obvious traders’ geography of the Ohio Valley marked everywhere by human movement. The Valley is criss-crossed with trading paths connecting a dense network of important Indian villages which a traveler would have encountered. These were the significant spaces of the valley, important nodes in the network of human exchanges that underwrote Pennsylvania’s claims to the region. By depicting roads and villages reconstructed from verbal accounts, Evans’s map provided a sense, however dim, of how moving through these places might have felt to the travelers of the Ohio Valley.</p>
<p>But the mapmaker also made great efforts to distance his printed map from the human communication networks that underwrote it. Evans moved most of the information that in another map might have appeared as legends into a published companion book. Evans’s Geographical, Historical, Political, Philosophical and Mechanical Essays. The First, Containing an Analysis of a General Map of the Middle British Colonies in America detailed the informants he consulted in the production of his map, as well as his techniques for “correcting” and corroborating them. The published book functions as a lengthier example of how mapmakers instructed their audiences to “read” their maps. The preface justifies the map as a way to increase the public’s ability to see and become acquainted with “these remoter Parts, where the Country is yet a wilderness.” (Evans, iii) Evans in the Analysis also disparages the imagination of the mapmaker, invoking it in places where he discussed observer error (Evans, iv., 3, 12). But he nonetheless encourages his readers to imagine themselves traveling through these landscapes. The Analysis describes the experience of rivers like the Schuykill, letting Evans’s readers know that, for example, “Schuylkill is a fine Branch, up which the Tide runs about five Miles above Philadelphia, where there is an impassable Fall; and three Miles higher up another not much better. Thence to Reading is a fine gliding Current easily set against, as the Bottom is gravelly and even.” (Evans, 21-22) The book provides lengthy descriptions of traveling over roads, through mountains, and along rivers, functioning as a sort of travel guide, carefully compiled by the author and provided to fire the imagination of the reader through rich descriptions of moving through these spaces, but always with Evans as the guide, exhorting readers to see the landscape in his own favored way.</p>
<p>The Fry and Jefferson map, on the other hand, takes a much different approach to mapping the Ohio Valley, even though the mapmakers consulted with Evans and had access to much of the same information. Fry and Jefferson, however, likely had less access to Pennsylvania traders and Ohio Valley Indians, since Virginians were largely outsiders to the human networks of the region. Virginians suffering from the constant uncertainty of the tobacco economy had great interest in the valley and desired to speculate in lands as a way of creating more stable wealth in the 1700s. (Holton, 3-6) Seizing on the colony’s ancient charter claims, Virginians began asserting their rights to the Ohio territories in the 1740s and 1750s. The problem was that the old charter claims did not hold up as well as the policy of land sales from Indians. Lacking the well-developed trading networks of Pennsylvania, Virginians had to find other ways to assert their authority over the Ohio Valley lands (which mostly involved some variety of swindle).</p>
<p>Fry had access to a particular information network linked to the Virginia militia and the agents of land speculators. Stationed at Winchester in the western part of the colony in the early 1750s, Fry mostly learned about the Ohio lands from militia rangers and Indian scouts. When he did travel to the Ohio Valley, he did so as part of a diplomatic mission devoted to securing land rights for Virginia speculators. Fry thus learned of the Ohio lands mostly from those who spent very little time living and traveling through the region. (Cumming, 28-29)</p>
<p>The result was a starkly blank map that reflected Virginians’ desire for the Ohio lands, not its peoples. Whether through ignorance or specific intention, Fry and Jefferson’s map provided almost no indication of the very real human presence on the western side of the mountains. Where Evans showed a region crossed by numerous pathways linking a web of villages and peoples, Fry and Jefferson indicated a blankness waiting to be sold to settlers—a perfect speculator’s map, in other words. Gone were Evans’s detailed legends highlighting the human knowledge that had made his map possible. Fry and Jefferson simply left the Ohio Valley as a blank unknown, awaiting settlement. In contrast to Lederer, however, who depicted the Appalachian ranges as a barrier to knowledge, Fry and Jefferson grid over the blank interior—a future landscape that awaited the easy incorporation into existing knowledge systems, presently unknown but easily knowable.</p>
${validate_component(Image, "Image").$$render($$result, { index: "6" }, {}, {})}
<p>But while Fry and Jefferson’s map was not so great at recording the dense tracks of informants, it did reveal a new sort of movement emerging in eighteenth-century maps—the imagined movement of future journeys. Across the empty Ohio, Fry and Jefferson included a table of mileages between prominent Virginia towns and the significant sites of fortification and conflict at the edge of the Ohio Valley: Winchester, Fort Necessity, Fort Duquesne. Fry and Jefferson thus drew lines to the edge of the Valley but left unmapped the continuation of those lines into the dense human networks mapped by Evans. Unlike Evans, who carefully shaped his readers’ impressions of an existing landscape through both his map and his Analysis, Fry and Jefferson tantalized readers with a supposedly unknown land—one that readers were then free to fill in with their own imagined future journeys.</p>
<p>While Fry and Jefferson did not explicitly attempt to fire their readers’ imaginations, continuing innovations in both map form and content throughout the later decades of the 1700s reveal that mapmakers were designing their charts around an imagining public. One of the Newberry’s copies of Henry Mouzon’s 1775 An Accurate Map of North and South Carolina indicates greater cultural changes surrounding mapmaking and especially map reading than simply the more accurate measurement of physical features. Its form is as important as its content as examples of changing Anglo-American map use. This cloth-backed version of the Mouzon map was meant to be folded and housed on bookshelves or in saddlebags, the form indicating that maps were becoming both more common and more portable, meant for frequent consultation but not for permanent display. (Although, as William Mylne learned, these folding maps did not always travel very well.) In contrast to the enormous wall maps and grand atlases still being produced in the 1700s, maps like Mouzons indicate other values for their readers—the desire to imagine movements in private reflection for practical reasons or even just for personal entertainment.</p>
<p>The eighteenth century was the early age of the popular map in Anglo-American culture. As the imperial desire for more maps led to more mapping, the advancing availability of print also allowed for wider distribution of these maps. The result was that an audience of map consumers grew up around the shops of London and Philadelphia and increasingly used maps as a way of visualizing the real-time events across the Atlantic. While someone like Moll needed to explain to his readers how to envision movement across the map, later productions assumed the audience knew. And this allowed them greater freedom to provide lively images of colonists moving across the land. A map such as Mouzon’s was of only limited use in traversing the landscape, but it was of great utility in granting the reader the illusion that they might know the landscape at a distance.</p>
<p>We know that Mouzon’s map in fact had two prominent figures use it for this purpose. Both George Washington and the Comte de Rochambeau owned copies of Mouzon’s map, with Washington’s map being a cloth-backed folding map similar to the one held by the Newberry (Cumming, 33). Generals and military planners of course relied on maps before the American Revolution, but what is of note here is that neither Washington nor Rochambeau were directly involved in the southern campaigns. Washington of course as commander of the Continental forces had oversight but he spent almost the entire war in the northern colonies. His generals and lieutenants planned the campaigns of the South. Washington and Rochambeau, however, used Mouzon’s map to make sense of their subordinates’ reports and to “observe” at a distance the movements of British armies across the landscape. In this sense, Washington and Rochambeau were just two more consumers and readers of maps, using their charts to imagine the past and future movements of armies otherwise invisible to their own eyes.</p>
<p>That such prominent figures were both consumers and users of maps indicates why the culture of map reading in the eighteenth century is worth further investigation. During the century, maps increasingly offered the larger viewing public access to the same perspective as generals and heads of state. More than just military planning, the increasingly available maps provided an increasingly map-literate public the ability to follow military movements from far away. The appearance of illustrated campaign maps in popular magazines during the 1700s indicates that these spurs to the imagination were growing more popular with the reading public. (Lehman, 341-344) More than simple aids to military planning, maps were increasingly part of a public imagination of war in the second half of the 1700s.</p>
<p>In addition to the visualized movements of armies across maps, the increased imagination of cartography could seemingly show readers other, slower movements of people across space and time. Three maps from the years of the American Revolution help demonstrate some of the ways in which Anglo-Americans were using their maps to do more than just recount the movements of explorers. They were using their maps to cultivate a particular culture of viewership that would have profound implications for how post-Revolutionary Americans envisioned their place in North America. John Stuart’s 1780 update of William de Brahm’s 1757 map of South Carolina revealed a nascent sense of maps as documents of social development. A 1775 map of the early days of the Revolution revealed a popular culture increasingly using maps to explain the events of the world. And a 1777 map of Charleston can be read as evidence of increasing efforts on the part of mapmakers to cater to the fantasy of travel.</p>
${validate_component(Image, "Image").$$render($$result, { index: "7" }, {}, {})}
<p>In 1757, a German military engineer named William de Brahm immigrated to the colony of Georgia, bringing with him a thorough education in scientific cartography. De Brahm made his first printed work that same year, publishing a map of the South Carolina and Georgia coastlines that has long been heralded for its “accurate” plotting of the tricky intra-coastal waterways and sea islands of the southeastern lowcountry. The interior, however, was far less engaging. Dismissing the information of non-cartographically-trained surveyors and informants, De Brahm mostly left the interior of his map blank, with rivers and roads trailing off into nothing. He did, as a service to Carolina promoters, show the locations of several recently created townships in the Carolina Piedmonts, divided into the neat little rectangles that the South Carolina government envisioned as key to new settlements in the interior.</p>
<p>Twenty-three years later, an updated version of the map revealed much more of the two colonies. No doubt hoping to take advantage of reader interest in the southern Revolutionary campaigns, John Stuart, Britain’s Superintendent for Indian Affairs for the southern colonies, updated De Brahm’s original map. Stuart had access to the records of surveyors and to printed maps such as Mouzon’s and so he filled De Brahm’s empty map with roads, counties, towns, and every other detail that war-curious readers might need to track the movements of armies across the region. The original township squares of De Brahm’s map still appeared, but had been overrun with new details and colored over in order to show county divisions. The effect was quite remarkable. In addition to showing readers where armies might be marching, Stuart also gave readers brightly colored “evidence” of how far settlement had pushed in the years since De Brahm’s original version appeared. The contrast is somewhat exaggerated, since De Brahm’s map excluded much information from the backcountry as unreliable. But Stuart’s map had the effect of demonstrating how far Carolinians had pushed outwards from the small little squares of an earlier map.</p>
<p>By including the older township squares, Stuart introduced a time component to his map. While it could be an example of eighteenth-century mapmaking thrift, with the printer simply re-using older engraved plates, the effect remained the same. South Carolina’s history of settlement and growth could unfold in the reader’s imagination as backcountry settlers spread out from the old township centers and filled the entire page with towns, courthouses, churches, and the other marks of “civilization” that an eighteenth-century reader would appreciate.</p>
<p>It is also an example of the kinds of map-based thinking and planning that would characterize Anglo-Americans’ expansion across the Appalachians. While earlier eighteenth-century colonial planners had believed in social engineering through precise town planning, these schemes had largely been associated with failed Utopian settlements such as the Margravate of Azilia and the Trustees charity colony of Georgia. However, maps such as Stuart’s indicated that Anglo-Americans had begun to believe that better mapping might lead to better success. Stuart’s map thus existed as part of a culture of map-based thinking that would also lead to the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 which believed that a harmonious American society could develop along clearly marked lines on a map.</p>
<p>The element of witnessing history in miniature appeared on other maps of the late 1700s. A 1775 London map titled “The Seat of War in New England” made this function of maps clear to its audience. Depictions of battle scenes were nothing new by 1775, not even in New England (one calls to mind John Seller’s image of fighting during King Philip’s War on his 1675 “Mapp of New England”). However, “The Seat of War” offered more than just the illustration of a dramatic episode. Like the Stuart map, this map indicated that slower, larger processes shaped human actions. In this instance, the long lines of troop movements and supply lines were the real story of the conflict rather than single, dramatic episodes, interesting and carefully depicted as they were here. Published to demonstrate the early conflicts of the American Revolution between April and June of 1775 provided readers with the opportunity to recreate for themselves an almost moving image of the Battles of Lexington and Concord and Bunker Hill. The map is a simple map of western Massachusetts, with roads and villages prominently marked. But, along these routes, the mapmaker has drawn (in profile) armed soldiers, horses, and artillery moving along the routes towards Lexington and Boston. The inset map of Boston likewise adds human drama to the mapped image, as explosions and clouds of smoke billow around the scene of Bunker Hill.</p>
<p>The combination of maps, cartoons, and narratives of war allowed for a new kind of imagination to take place. The reader could take the bird’s-eye-view of events and see more than any individual could. Unlike heroic paintings such as Benjamin West’s “The Death of General Wolfe”, the reader could claim a super-human perspective on events and “see” how things unfolded across space and time. From this perch, they could then perhaps understand the causes of notable successes or failures (as with the British attempts to curb the rebellion in 1775). The development of eighteenth-century maps therefore may have played some role in the development of a historical consciousness in that century.</p>
<p>This represented a remarkable change from the journey maps of someone like Lederer. There, the map was constrained to a single person’s perspective. The trader maps, linked as they were to the personal memories of a collected body of informers, were variable and changing. But as the surveys improved and the “background” of physical terrain became more and more fixed, the maps of the later eighteenth century gave readers’ minds more freedom to roam about the landscape. A reader could “see” more than ever and this perhaps explains, in an age of democratizing knowledge and political power, why maps became such popular objects. They became a means of travel in and of themselves rather than records of another person’s movement across landscapes.</p>
${validate_component(Image, "Image").$$render($$result, { index: "8" }, {}, {})}
<p>The stylistic innovations of Joseph F.W. Des Barres provide further indication of a potentially changing culture of map reading. Like Evans, Des Barres was an outsider to the London printing houses that dominated the Anglo-American map trade and, like Evans, this gave Des Barres perhaps more freedom to experiment with map forms and creation processes, experimentation that resulted in the publication of Des Barres’s Atlantic Neptune atlas between 1774 and 1782. Des Barres in particular took advantage of Britain’s interest in the Revolutionary era to earn his funding directly from Parliament, given the military uses to which his elaborate coastal charts could be put (Hornsby, 164). The maps themselves were the result of Surveyor General of the Northern District Samuel Holland’s coastal surveys of America and the publication was made possible by the enlistment of unnamed engravers and artists in London, so it is difficult to say with certainty that Des Barres was the sole visionary behind the maps. But whoever shaped the vision, there is little doubt that the American Neptune represents a different relationship to the movements and imaginations of source material, compiler/cartographer, and reader in the 1700s.</p>
<p>The Atlantic Neptune used new visual approaches to create a visual separation between the information of humans and the supposedly fixed and unchanging landscape upon which humans operated. Des Barres and his artists included numerous legends and verbal descriptions right on the faces of their maps but, unlike earlier mapmakers, they isolated the text from the cartographic information. Whereas someone like Moll typically inserted their legends within the map’s grid lines and placed no borders around them, Des Barres isolated his legends within medallions drawn off-grid. The effect is a trompe l’oeil where the human knowledge appears as pieces of writing laid across the map, resting above it but not embedded within it (see maps in Hornsby, 138, 166, 189).</p>
<p>The Newberry’s collection of the Atlantic Neptune maps provides numerous examples of this technique but the 1777 map of Charleston, South Carolina, is a particularly striking example. Like the rest of the atlas, the map is primarily a nautical chart of the environs of Charleston, South Carolina, including sand bars and depth measurements. In this, it was much of a piece with Des Barres nautical charts of the northeastern North American coastline that formed the bulk of the Atlantic Neptune. Some land features (plantations, roads) are marked on the map but are blended together under a uniform brown wash. The meeting of water and land is the central feature of this map, save for a colorful inset in the map’s upper left.</p>
<p>Here, Des Barres went for an artistic touch over and above those provided elsewhere in the atlas. Rather than the usual harbor scenes with boats in the middle distance that characterized much of the trompe l’oeil insets in his other maps, this Charleston map included an untitled landscape view of the town as seen from the southern bank of the Ashley River. It was a bucolic, pastoral scene of livestock herders tending a few cattle resting on the sandy banks of the river. Keeping to form, the engraver did include a small sailing vessel (a “petiaugua” or local sailing vessel common along southeastern shores and associated with local exchange) but the view is from land rather than from a sea approach. The harbor of Charleston itself, one of the busiest in North America, has almost no ships. The hard work of rice, Carolina’s largest export, is missing from the scene entirely. The image therefore stands in sharp contrast to the bustling commercial scenes common to eighteenth-century cartouches (see the Fry-Jefferson or De Brahm maps for comparison).</p>
<p>The image is clearly meant to be read as almost completely separate from the map. This image is not linked to the map in any way. It was set off at an angle to the map’s grid, a bit of illusion to highlight the separation between the cartographic vision and the traveler’s vision. The map allows two views. One view is the cartographic: its precise delineation of a complex hydrography, measured and enumerated at all necessary points, authenticated from the most professional naval surveys (as the title indicates). The other view is that of the traveler, happening upon a restful scene after a trip overland. The two views are separated on this map as Des Barres makes a claim for the “proper” relationship between cartography and movement: maps can bring you to your destination, where you can then enjoy the local scenery. In 1777, Des Barres foreshadowed the tourist map and the complex relationship between cartography and movement that would help define the future United States as a country of movers and travelers.</p>
<p>These few examples from the years of the American Revolution point the way towards new areas of investigation. The nineteenth century has long been recognized as the age when North Americans spent their efforts turning their grand ambitions into transcontinental realities. By examining the particular circumstances around late colonial maps in the British colonies, one has the chance to witness that continental ambition forming. North Americans became map-loving people around the same time that the United States gained independence. Much about that shape and direction of the country could be gleaned from the map-based thinking that surrounded its formation.</p>`;

  return `<p>Mapping movement over water, particularly the transport of goods and passengers by way of rivers, lakes, canals, and intracoastal waterways, is an integral part in the story of the development of North America. Our focus here is on how waterways were conceived and developed, maintained and improved across the continent. The technologies employed, initially developed in the Old World, brought new ways of transport and travel to the New World, stimulating fresh approaches to conquering space and improving life. Maps stood behind the whole process, but needed new ways of reading them to reveal their unique qualities and full potential.</p>
<p>This project uses two brief essays and twenty focus maps to introduce readers to the cartography of waterways in North America over the last several centuries. The first essay discusses the special qualities of these maps and then notes their origin in Europe. The second essay picks up the story in North America and brings the account up to the present day. Ten focus maps, arranged chronologically, accompany each essay, but together, they outline the story of travel and commercial exchange over water. At the same time each focus map has something to say about the unique characteristics of waterways cartography. The commentary for each map therefore uses a variety of approaches to develop contexts for understanding, appreciating, and critiquing them.</p>
<p>What is unique about maps focusing on waterways? Does a reader need any special preparation to read them with deep understanding and to use them to advantage? How many different types of waterway maps were drawn to help shape the continent? Why were they created? What insights might they provide to fathom the main currents in American thought?</p>
<p>With these questions in mind, let us define some basic terms. A map is a graphic image that shows aspects of the earth’s surface to help us think about the world. We study the surface and then mine the layers of meaning under it, probing for hidden depths, secret arguments, and cultural reflections. A “way,” in turn, is a route or path for movement. So, at the most basic level, waterway maps employ hydrographic features to convey information and/or arguments about the movement of goods or passengers by way of water, or in some examples, the conveyance of water itself for irrigation, drainage, or consumption. Some of these waterways mapped are natural, others, “Canals,” are artificial, made by people for these purposes.</p>
<p>One of the oldest extant maps in the Western tradition, a plan of the Mesopotamian city of Nippur, inscribed on a clay tablet with a reed stylus over three millennia ago, features the Nunbirdu Canal. One hesitates to label this example as a waterways map because the canal is not the focus of the map: It is just one physical feature among others, such as walls, temples, and palaces, which defined the urban fabric. However, if the main map had an inset to show the route of the canal, or the harbor facilities at the city, then we would consider the entire effort as a waterways map. Definitions are difficult, and categories often cause confusion, but “waterways maps,” as used here, center on rivers, lakes, and canals, and are primarily employed as parts of transportation systems. However, the rubric also extends to natural and artificial works dedicated to irrigation, flood control, water conveyance, and other commercial or recreational purposes.</p>

<h3>Reading Canal Maps</h3>
<p>Canal maps are only one type of waterways cartography, but understanding their nature and function will help readers put the entire corpus into context. First, note that canal maps often come in two distinctly different parts: The isometric view of the canal directly overhead as the waterway crosses its territory and a sideways view showing the elevation of the various pools created by dams and usually separated by locks. The second view ordinarily employs a vertical scale much larger than the horizontal one. A third perspective, occasionally employed, is a cutaway section across the width of the canal to demonstrate how a boat would float upon its waters. Here the horizontal and vertical scales would be identical, or at least much closer together. A fourth feature, understood but not often presented graphically, is the need for feeder systems to keep enough water in the waterway to float the boats. Here reservoirs, dams, lateral canals, raceways, regulating channels, and the like are involved. A map recognizing the difficulty of maintaining constant water levels in canals shows the main passageway as only one part of a complex engineering system. A variety of maps, diagrams, drawings and tables are thus usually needed to fully explain the entire system suggested on the main sheet.</p>
<p>Maps of rivers also need multiple images and perspectives because the waters vary so much between high and low levels. Isometric maps need to show the river at various stages, reaching out to cover the entire flood plain, sometimes even extending further to define the stream’s entire basin. Rivers are constantly changing their course, eroding some banks and depositing the materials elsewhere, creating new vegetation patterns, opening and closing channels, and moving islands downstream. In short, rivers are wild and canals have tamed their waters, best viewed as complicated machines in motion. These dynamic factors must be taken into account whenever one consults any waterways map.</p>
<p>Translating the variability and complexity of waterways into stable economic terms leads to two major considerations somewhat contradictory in nature. The first is how people have found ways to regulate water flows and levels. The second is their desire to emphasize the advantages of water transport by maximizing the carrying capacity of the vessels employed on the waterway. The development of dams, reservoirs, and locks from the seventeenth century onward created a set of solutions to the first factor, and the use of steam and later diesel power addressed the second issue. By the dawn of the twenty-first century it was practical to assemble as many as forty or fifty barges, aggregating up to 80,000 tons, into one tow powered by a single tugboat. This was accomplished on the lower Mississippi River where a deep channel is maintained for about 700 miles without a lock.</p>
<p>Upstream on the Great River, where locks are required at regular intervals, the expense of enlarging the facilities to accommodate such tows has posed problems. On the other hand, breaking down the tows and reassembling them after proceeding through smaller locks raises time and labor costs, factors which cut into the economic advantage of waterborne commerce. Knowledgeable people view waterways maps in terms of transportation units, that is, the number of tons times the number of miles moved in a single hour of labor cost for one person. Thus deeper beds, expanded locks, larger vessels, more powerful engines, and reduced labor costs all increase the viability of an inland navigation system. But larger facilities also dramatically increase the amount of capital investment required, may reduce the flexibility of the system, and may also have greater impact on river ecosystems.</p>
<p>Another factor, historically very significant but usually not readily apparent on waterways maps, is the push to find ways to cross summits between water- courses. Locks are most challenging to operate at the highest point on the divide between natural basins because they must be kept full of water at a place where it is seldom readily available. Inventors and engineers have been kept busy over the years searching for ways to overcome this challenge of the summits.</p>
<p>Inclined planes, mechanical lifts, shoots of various types, railroads, and huge containers designed to hold entire ships loaded with cargo and hoist them over an embankment, were all suggested and tried in order to conquer summits over the centuries. The United States, facing labor shortages during the Canal Era, often took a leadership role in these experiments. The inclines on the Morris Canal, put into operation in 1831, were constantly reengineered to make them more efficient. The basic idea was to use a lock ladder to bring coal barges to a summit and then slide them down the slope on the other side. The end result, employing inclined planes for both ascent and descent, gained international fame and became a classic example of how to reduce the construction of expensive locks. (<a href="/waterways-cartography-part-2/1882-inland-canals#top">Focus Map 11</a>) The New Jersey canal continued in operation until 1924 when an expanding population lowered the water table and took away an economical water supply.</p>
${validate_component(Image, "Image").$$render($$result, { index: "6" }, {}, {})}
<p>In the 1840s the use of railroads to portage canal boats across the summits of the Pennsylvania mountains to connect the Delaware and Ohio rivers also gained fame in the annals of transportation technology, but it soon succumbed to economic pressures brought on largely by improvements in the trunk-line railroads that offered direct competition. The Pennsylvania Mainline Canal thus flourished for a mere twenty years, one major stumbling block being the labor expense of detaching the canal boats into their four compartment sections to fit on the railway cars and then reassembling them at the other end of the portage. Nevertheless, the entire Pennsylvania canal system rivaled that of New York State for a short time and demonstrated how a coordinated entity could use varying technologies to address the specific challenges of a site to the benefit of the entire transportation system.</p>
<p>Therefore a major consideration when reading waterways maps, especially those showing canals, is that they are often accompanied by engineering drawings showing how specific topographical challenges were or would be addressed. Indeed, a full complement of maps for a canal would go beyond the typical route map to also picture the waterway in profile as well as cross section ad then portray its water management area, featuring reservoirs, feeders, and drainage facilities, often reaching to the full extent of the drainage basin, and finally featuring drawings of locks, inclines, or other engineering solutions used at specific sites along the way.</p>
<p>But there are even more challenges to reading canal maps. The numerous technologies employed, the varying widths used on different canals, the dissimilar lengths of their locks, and the need to use barges specifically built for the depth of each canal—these complications are not readily apparent on most canal maps. What looks like an integrated system on a map often turns out to be a collection of unique units.</p>
<p>Scale posed another issue in waterways cartography. Should inland navigation maps follow the conventions of naval practice? Specifically, should they use statute miles usually employed for measuring land areas, the length of which is set by law, or should they use nautical miles determined by the length of one minute of latitude? The difference is that one nautical mile equals 1.15 US statute miles. Similarly, should speed be measured in knots or in miles per hour? Canal maps generally used land-based measurements, but maps of the Great Lakes and the Intracoastal Waterways often spoke the language of nautical charts.</p>
<p>The inclusion of coastal maps in this study (<a href="/waterways-cartography-part-2/1949-intracoastal-waterway-nj#top">Focus Map 19</a>) is dictated by the fact that boats primarily designed for inland waters often venture out into the ocean for short distances. Moreover, the construction of the Intracoastal Waterway along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts specifically encouraged the use of such watercraft for coastal voyages. This practice, although not unique to North America, was certainly encouraged by the continent’s submerged coastal plain along the Atlantic and Gulf shores.</p>
<p>In sum, waterways maps, like all types of maps, are difficult to confine within specific boundaries. The edges of maps always whisper to informed readers that there is more beyond the neat lines marking the end of coverage. The geography always extends further than the cartography, even on world maps that often omit coverage of the very high latitudes. Map readers need to keep reminding themselves that there is more space beyond the sheet at hand, connected in many ways to the area portrayed, off the map but still part of the story.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the time factor. Every map, to be complete, needs a date. What time does it present? Is the information current? Or, does it portray a world now past, but calibrated to a specific date? Many times maps use a generalized past, combining data from various years or periods into one extended unit of time. On other occasions, maps present future plans or possibilities not yet realized. From the very beginning, English maps of canals distinguished between waterways proposed, chartered, under construction, and in operation. American cartographers generally followed this practice for transportation mapping, and alert readers will always consult the key to keep the distinctions in mind.</p>
<p>Hopefully these comments urging readers of waterways maps to “keep their heads up” will not turn them away from using these maps or appreciating the riches they have to offer. Moving water has always fascinated humankind, and the prospect of moving over water quickens our blood. Rivers and lakes, at the very least, put flesh on the dry bones of our map. Hydrographic features provide locations and create a sense of place. Cartographic portrayals of lakes, rivers, and canals, like the physical features themselves, have become part of our culture, both in their own right and in terms of how the people use them. In history as well as in legend, they are ingredients in recipes for the American way, major sources for documenting the American experience. They furnish telling mirrors for understanding ourselves and our situation.</p>
<p>Waterways cartography may have appeared before the practice of writing itself. Both were connected. One way to explain the rise of civilization is to point to the shift from rainfall agriculture to irrigation with the resulting dramatic increase in production. When water could be channeled and regulated, engineering and technical knowledge became especially valuable, larger public works were put into place, cities developed, laws were made, and written records were kept. Canal maps, now lost in the shifting sands of time, probably stood behind the whole process.</p>

<h3>The European Background</h3>
<p>Engineering designs, plans, and surveys must have facilitated the construction of many ancient canals that are known today only from written references or the archaeological record. This type of mapping has generally not survived, but the notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci, which sketch canals and hydrographic works for Italy in the Renaissance, are one exception. The earliest printed waterways maps did not appear until over a century later in France. One of the first of these is spectacular, and the waterway it portrays is even more so. The Languedoc Canal, or the Canal du Midi, on which construction was started in 1666, was completed under the direction of a talented amateur, Pierre-Paul Riquet, in 1681. Its design rested on the technology of the Briare Canal near Paris completed fifty years earlier, but it also utilized the experience of water management systems developed in the Low Countries and in Italy. Moreover, it depended on the common knowledge of local folk, including the management of stream flow by women.</p>
<p>No one is sure of the exact way the knowledge of hydrographic engineering was diffused throughout Europe, but it burst into public consciousness in Languedoc where a hundred locks, a long tunnel, and three major aqueducts carried barges from the Bay of Biscay on the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea. In the process, cargo took a short cut and avoided problems in the Strait of Gibraltar, a military advantage that helped finance the entire effort. The Midi Canal marked a coming of age of canal engineering, and the inquisitive American, Thomas Jefferson, a century later, had a carriage fixed to a barge so he could travel, as a passenger, over the entire length of the waterway in comfort. Jefferson spent nine days on the canal, walking along the towpath or riding in his carriage, where he could “read, write, or observe,” with a map at hand, we suppose. There is no doubt that Jefferson knew how to read it with understanding for he devoted a whole day to investigate, on horseback, “the manner in which water has been collected to supply the canal.” (Jefferson 1787, 415-446)</p>
<p>The celebratory map <em>Le Canal Royal de Languedoc…</em> which I. B. Nolin published in Paris in 1697, echoes the spirit of the Midi canal in its elaborate presentation of it. Basically a strip map showing the canal’s route, it also features extensions showing the feeder reservoirs. The dozens of coats of arms that surround the map are surmounted by a royal tribute. Forty-seven plans of locks and engineering features, plus five inset maps, fill up the margins of the three folio sheets pasted together to accommodate all the information and decorations, turning the map into a virtual atlas. The cartouche at the center shows Neptune exchanging ships with a maiden representing the Mediterranean Sea. A reader needs at least an hour to fully explore the map. French engineers devoted the next century-and-a-half to connecting its two seventeenth-century canals with a network of waterways that was well underway before the English built their first modern canal. Nevertheless, North American waterway maps are firmly anchored in an English rather than a French cartographic tradition.</p>
<p>The modern canal era in England suddenly came to life in 1759 when the engineer James Brindley completed a canal for the Duke of Bridgewater to haul coal to Manchester. The waterway became a landmark in the Industrial Revolution and was followed by a multitude of similar projects. Each one needed a separate act of Parliament to proceed, and the procedure was soon regularized with maps playing essential roles.</p>
<p>Geologist John Farey, Sr.’s long article on canals in the 39-volume <em>Cyclopaedia, Or Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences</em> (1803-1820), compiled by Abraham Rees, refers to eight steps in developing a canal. Maps were needed at every stage. The process was outlined as follows:</p>
<ol><li><p>An initial survey of the line proposed</p></li>
<li><p>A complete plan to show the local impact and to detail the facilities needed: culverts, drains, bridges, water supply works, roads, and the like</p></li>
<li><p>Plans to accompany the “books of reference” required to be submitted with the application to Parliament for a charter, certified and “lodged with the county clerk” for public inspection and with the company clerk for stockholders to consult</p></li>
<li><p>A general route map to assist in selling stock for the company</p></li>
<li><p>Land surveys to record the purchase of land parcels required for the improvement</p></li>
<li><p>Detailed construction plans needed for the “acts applying,” and local customs</p></li>
<li><p>Maps and plans to facilitate the management and operation of the enterprise</p></li>
<li><p>Similar maps to explore future developments and secure extensions or connections to expand the enterprise because it was in the nation’s interest to join individual projects together, creating a national system of waterways.</p></li></ol>
<p>Large-scale sheets showing the route were also required so that property owners, at the very beginning of the enterprise, could gauge the impact the development would have on their lands. Small-scale maps of the route designed to promote the sale of shares in the company could be more general, even decorative, in nature. On the other hand, the engineering maps and diagrams needed to direct construction activities called for a high level of accuracy, especially when work was carried out at more than one place at the same time.</p>
<p>However, the classic British canal map that appeared about three decades after the Bridgewater Canal was completed followed none of these specific examples. Instead of focusing on one waterway, it portrayed the whole “system” of inland navigation in England. John Phillips included this map in his <em>General History of Inland Navigation, Foreign and Domestic, containing a Complete Account of the Canals Already Executed in England, with Considerations on those Projected</em> (London,1792). Originally published in two large volumes, a second edition appeared three years later, followed by several more versions, including a less expensive quarto edition, within the next decade. The fourth edition, dated 1803, was not only corrected and updated, but also abridged and reduced in price to reach a wider audience.</p>
${validate_component(Image, "Image").$$render($$result, { index: "7" }, {}, {})}
<p>By the time this popular version appeared, “canal fever,” already past its peak in Britain, had started to break out in the new United States. Interestingly, Phillips listed as the second of his qualifications for writing the book the fact that he had spent “some years” in America as “a prisoner on parole.” His first qualification was his employment “by the great Brindley, the father of English canals,” but experience in America furnished “reasonable pretensions to a proper knowledge of the subject.” “No part of the world,” he concluded, “is so well watered…as the territories of the American States.” Nature had started the job and canals would perfect it, converting the United States into “a number of large fertile islands, uniting and trading with each other with ease and small expense.” (572-573) The author then devoted about ten pages to various proposed canals in progress or proposed in America. Hailing the “the immortal Washington…[as] the original father and promoter of these canals and improvements…. Twice the savior of his country,” he had set it on the course to prosperity as well as liberty. With canals, the US economy would soon “astonish Europe.”</p>
<p>As you can see, there was little doubt in European eyes that inland navigation in America should be considered on a national level and seen as a great engine of prosperity. Abraham Rees no doubt had an edition of Phillips’ study at hand when he entered the article on canals into his <em>Cyclopaedia</em>. Although the entry was the longest one in the entire thirty-nine-volume work, it needed a map similar to the one in <em>Inland Navigation</em> to tell the story. So Farey reported, at the conclusion of the “Canals” entry, that he intended to supply such a map in an appended atlas volume showing how England was served by an internal system of “navigable rivers, canals, rail-ways, harbors, etc.” The map, copyright on May 1, 1818, duly appeared in the atlas supplement (volume 45) to the <em>Cyclopaedia.</em> All of the maps in this world atlas are general reference maps except for the one titled “Canals, Navigations, and Railways of Great Britain,” which is a stellar example of an early thematic map devoted to transportation.</p>
<p>Now this fact, seemingly of only antiquarian interest, may be critical to the history of American cartography in general and its maps of internal navigation in particular. Rees’s <em>Cyclopaedia</em>, in spite of its great size, found a home in the United States. A consortium of almost every leading printer in the country came together to support the US edition of the great work. Financial difficulties faced the project at every turn, but it was eventually published in 47 volumes between 1810 and 1824. The US edition’s article on canals, well over 100,000 words in length, repeats much of the information in the London version but devotes about one-tenth of the space to projects proposed and under construction in the United States, covering the story up to about 1804.</p>
<p>This long section on canals in the United States begins by echoing the optimism, even the very words, of Phillips: Artificial waterways would perfect “the most intimate union” formed by nature, converting the United States “into a cluster of large and fertile islands, communicating with each other, with ease and little expense, and, in many instances without the uncertainty and danger of the sea.” The accompanying atlas to the English version was also duly reproduced in the US, even the exceptional map of the canals of Great Britain. The map may be viewed as an inspiration for the new country, although directed to a British audience, because the theme of a system of waterways seemed to fit the United States as well. Think of the national map “of canal-making, and of river-navigations and railways as forming one great, compound, and connected <em>System of Internal Communication</em>.” Only then, the entry continued, should one consider “individual establishments of this kind.” The reader would do well to start with this basic concept when reading their maps as well: Thinking of individual areas in terms of the larger systems of which they form a part.</p>
<p>The US edition concluded its section on canals in the new nation with a stirring vision enunciated by James Cammack of Georgia. He envisioned a nation crisscrossed by canals, main trunks with their subordinates, “intersected, like the streets, lanes and avenues of a great city; with channels of conveyance for the wealth, produce and internal commerce of the whole.”</p>
<p>The accompanying atlas, in the US version, largely followed the London edition, containing, in the same order, ancient and modern maps. The United States now appeared in two sheets, the northern part to the Mississippi River and the southern part to the Rio Grande, both “compiled from the best authorities by John Melish.” Dated July, 1818, the first one prematurely showed Illinois as a state. Thus it was one version of Melish’s celebrated national map. Different engravers, often without identification, worked on these encyclopedia maps, mostly in Philadelphia, then the center of American publishing and mapmaking.</p>
<p>The celebrated English canal map appeared in a virtually identical US version, providing an example and stimulus to the new nation. The American cartographer who seemed to benefit most from this example was Henry S. Tanner. Along with his older brother, Benjamin, and brother-in-law William Darby, the younger Tanner soon became a pillar of his profession, and <a href="/waterways-cartography-part-1/1829-canals-and-railroads#top">his 1829 map of the nation</a> can be considered a magnificent landmark celebrating transportation cartography as well as the mother map of a United States bound into one nation by the ties of roads, waterways, and railroads. But by then a series of notable images for internal navigation had already been produced. The first of these was published in London, and so as we end the story of the European background to North American waterways cartography in Philadelphia, we must recross the Atlantic Ocean to begin the story of waterways maps by North Americans, the focus of Essay II.</p>

<h4>Further Reading</h4>
<p>The previous discussion of canal and waterways maps is in some ways unique in that it employs their cartography to explore North American history, especially how inland waters carried passengers and freight back and forth across the continent as economic, political, social, and cultural functions. There are literally thousands of excellent books and articles that tell the story of virtually every canal, waterway, river, lake, inland port, and navigation system that has served the continent’s inhabitants. Maps have attended these studies in two ways: (1) as primary sources left behind after the planning, building, use, modification, and overall functioning of the particular facility and (2) as creations by later people who turned to cartography to narrate the tale or gauge the effectiveness of particular works, routes, or functions of these waterways.</p>
<p>From the very start scholars at various times have surveyed the major existing works and systems and described them in a systematic way. The entry on “Canals” in both the original British and subsequent American edition of the <em>Cyclopaedia</em> compiled by Abraham Rees serve this function on a global scale. George Armroyd’s <em>A Connected View of the Whole Internal Navigation of the United States</em> appeared in two editions, 1826 and 1830 (reprinted, 1971), needing over 600 pages to complete its coverage.</p>
<p>A major effort by the Division of Transportation of the Carnegie Institution of Washington in the early twentieth century led to several dozen studies by individual scholars which formed the base for a summary <em>History of Transportation in the United States before 1860</em> (1917) prepared under the direction of Balthasar Henry Meyer by Caroline E. MacGill and her staff. This landmark volume was reprinted in 1948. <em>The Preliminary Report of the Inland Waterways</em> <em>Commission</em> published by the Government Printing Office as a Senate Document in 1908 had a different function, but ranged widely in gathering background information of great use to later scholars. It was reprinted in 1972.</p>
<p>In contrast, to these lengthy tomes, most readers learned about <em>Old Towpaths: The Story of the American Canal Era</em> from the sprightly book by Alvin F. Harlow issued in 1926. It is a nostalgic account, ending in a lament for a world that lost out to “the neurotic whirl of our present-day business and social life.” Although it is comprehensive in its coverage, its usefulness is limited by the absence of notes and the lack of an index. Moreover, its tone has shaded the popular image of the canal era and suggested that waterways disappeared with the coming of the railroad. The cartographic record, of course, tells a different tale and one must convert to a divergent mindset to reap the full benefits of these maps.</p>
<p>Going further will be a do-it-yourself project for the researcher, but let me suggest eight reading assignments that might be useful in getting started. First, the researcher should use a survey of the Canal Era in the United States, 1790-1860 by a modern scholar such as Ronald E. Shaw’s <em>Canals for a Nation</em> (1990), a brief account that touches many topics and themes. The second and third suggestions are to read two books in tandem: Forest G. Hill, <em>Roads, Rails, &amp; Waterways: The Army Engineers and Early Transportation</em> (1957) and Arthur Maass, <em>Muddy Waters: The Army Engineers and the Nation’s Rivers</em> (1951). This would be best followed by a book or an article in the continuing debate between natural free-flow advocates and those confident in engineering solutions to riverine problems.</p>
<p>The fourth and fifth suggestions are to use some deeper history to illuminate the European context for America’s use of waterways as transportation arteries. The researcher would be well served to start with L. T.C. Rolt’s <em>From Sea to Sea: The Canal du Midi</em> (1973), then to read Chandra Mukerji’s, <em>Impossible Engineering</em> (2009), the same topic seen through several different lenses, and conclude with her article, “Printing, Cartography, and Conceptions of Place in Renaissance Europe,” in <em>Media, Culture, and Society</em>, 28:5 (September, 2006), 651-669.</p>
<p>The next two approaches involve much less arduous reading. The sixth, <em>Towpaths to Tugboats: A History of American Canal Engineering</em> (1985) is a pamphlet published by the American Canal and Transportation Center for a popular audience. It hails the achievements of the engineers as milestones on the road to progress. The other suggestion, the seventh, is a clearly written scientific study, <em>Hydrology and Environmental Aspects of Erie Canal (1817-99)</em>. The illustrations alone in this ninety-two-page report, US Geological Survey Water-Supply Paper number 2018, are worth the price of admission.</p>
<p>The eighth, and final, recommendation starts with Robert C. Post’s <em>Technology, Transport, and Travel in American History</em> (2003), a short volume in the Historical Perspectives on Technology, Society, and Culture series issued by the American Historical Association and the Society for the History of Technology. Three of its nine chapters deal with Canals, the Inland Seacoast, and Riverways. Brief essays, followed by several pages of useful notes are really a preface to a long bibliography.</p>
<p>In the end, going researching further depends on where one’s subject is planted. It will be necessary to use local sources and state or regional finding aids to discover materials of use. But one should not neglect general or related documents. Remember: Developing a context for the research will provide keys to its meaning and significance. Several of Post’s suggestions will probably be useful springboards, but I have my own favorites to add to his list:</p>

  return `<p>“No part of the world is so well watered as the territories of the United States.” These words of John Phillips in the fourth edition of his <em>General History of Inland Navigation</em> (1803) broadcast what was both a boon and a challenge to Americans. Already a classic work in its own right, Phillips’ lengthy study, first published in 1792, honed the arguments for canals to a wide audience in the English-speaking world. As late as 1819 it was translated into French in an effort to develop and expand Britain’s internal transportation network. As we have seen in the preceding essay on canals and waterways, the <em>General History of Inland Navigation</em> had an earlier and even more forceful impact in North America. No people would benefit more from internal improvements than those in the United States, Phillips declared. “Just look at the map,” his refrain went, starting where you will along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts and noting how the bays or rivers reach deep inland, almost touching the great inland lakes and the mighty Mississippi basin. Connections between and extensions of these waterways across the Atlantic Coastal Plain spurred canal efforts in almost every state along the Atlantic littoral, while gaps in the Appalachian barrier incited dreams of monumental public works to climb over the mountains and connect the Atlantic Seaboard with the North American interior by means of artificial watercourses.</p>

<h3>Early Visions</h3>
<p>The US version of Abraham Rees’s <em>Cyclopaedia, Or Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences</em>, which used Phillips’s work to reach a broad audience, has an importance in the story that goes beyond its monumental size. As a series of scientific handbooks, profusely illustrated, it tied the American mind to the Enlightenment and the scientific method more firmly than any other publication. A corollary spelled out the application of this knowledge to the improvement of social and economic life. It was no accident that probably the most influential article in the British edition was a brilliant piece on the steam engine written by John Farey Jr., the son of the author of the entry on canals. These two long articles, one on canals and the other on steam engines, read in tandem, became a primer for the Industrial Revolution in North America. Canals came first, but the nineteenth century was to be the “Age of Steam.”</p>
<p>The massive effort needed to produce such an enormous and expensive set of books as the Rees’ <em>Cyclopaedia</em> required every resource the American printing industry could muster. The first volume of the London edition of this monumental work appeared in 1802. The complete set utilized a hundred contributors and 39 million words in 39 volumes of text, plus five volumes of plates and an atlas. Although the final installment did not appear in print until 1820, Samuel F. Bradford, a leading Philadelphia printer, envisioned an American version, “in about twenty volumes,” with a half-volume appearing every two months.</p>
<p>In spite of many challenges, including the war of 1812, when invading British troops burned down the warehouse where printed pages for the encyclopedia were stored, and the subsequent bankruptcy of Bradford’s publishing house, the Philadelphia-published edition of the Cyclopaedia kept pace with the British original. It was eventually acquired by a group of Philadelphia engravers and copublished by almost two dozen additional firms in the United States, printers and booksellers located from Maine to Georgia and as far west as Kentucky. The US edition also grew like Topsy. In the final push to complete the 47-volume <em>Cyclopaedia</em>, the state of Pennsylvania supported the project by authorizing a lottery. When the final volume, the atlas, appeared in 1824, four years after the completion of the London original, almost two thousand subscribers were listed at the end, including patrons as far west as Kaskaskia, Illinois on the Mississippi River and even readers living abroad, such as the members of the American Missionary Society in Bombay, India. It has been estimated that sixty American engravers worked on the final six volumes of plates. Most of the work involved direct copies of the pirated London version. Like the original atlas, the US edition included only one thematic map, the one on English Canals and Railways first published in 1820. By then, however, several important canal maps had already addressed an American audience, but none of them presented an integrated inland transportation system for the entire nation in the tradition of Phillips and Rees.</p>
<p>The first landmark North American publication on inland waterways was Robert Fulton’s <em>Treatise on the Improvement of Canal Navigation</em> (London, 1796). It has been overshadowed by Fulton’s fame in conjunction with Hudson River steamboats and was soon neglected because he advocated, as the long title of his book explained, “the numerous advantages to be derived from small canals,” rather than expensive, full-scale internal improvements. But if one continues down the page, past the first dozen lines of the title, one notes that the volume also included “Observations on the great Importance of Water Communications.” The volume was published in London at the Architectural Library and attracted the attention of knowledgeable readers, including both John Phillips and Abraham Rees. It swam against the current in advocating small canals when the economics (and politics) involved soon favored larger ones. Fulton’s ideas then faded out of sight until the development of standardized container shipping in our own times.</p>
<p>What Fulton envisaged was a type of container (his small boats were twenty feet long and thirty inches wide) that could be moved over land by way of small canals with portages afforded by different types of lifts and carriages that Fulton described in a series of exquisite plates. Adding wheels would make it possible to load these small boats at a distance from a waterway, convey them to a small canal, and use little tunnels (forty inches wide and nine feet high) to shuttle them through divides into the next waterway.</p>
<p>Thus a modest investment could extend the advantages of canals and waterways “into every nook and corner” where a small cargo could be collected. “The country will be nourished,” he continued, “as veins feed the constitution.” Canals would have many branches, like rivers themselves, and the small boats would then be linked together like chains on the larger waterways. Small units would not only be less expensive but also encourage regularity both in the sense of interchangeable containers and standardized schedules.</p>
<p>Fulton concluded his book with a letter to Thomas Mifflin, the then Governor of Pennsylvania. He pointed out that the Commonwealth’s western lands, currently as “uncultivated as the interior of Africa,” could be transformed by canals. The continent had an abundance of natural rivers beyond the tide, but they should, in Fulton’s view, be used only as feeders to supply water to artificial canals. Rivers were wild, threatening the stability of any artifice people would create for their improvement. They also did not flow directly between settlements. A system of canals, both small branches and trunk lines, could improve the situation and “bind the whole country in the bonds of social intercourse.” The population would then multiply, land values would increase, industry would be stimulated, and the nation would “rise to unparalled importance, by virtue of so powerful an ally as canals.”</p>
<p>Fulton’s book should be considered an engineering treatise because it included “thoughts on, and designs for, aqueducts and bridges of iron and wood” as well as his proposals for a water-borne transportation system. Although he illustrated the volume with seventeen exquisite plates, most of these portrayed machines and devices. A few could be considered landscapes, but they were generalized proposals, not pictures of specific places. There were no maps. The elements Fulton advocated were detached from specific sites and presented for general application. The essential graphics were drawings of canal boats and sketches of mechanical devices in operation. After Fulton published his book, he moved on to Paris and to other interests, maintaining his convictions on the importance of waterways and the future of the US but gaining new insights into the possibilities opened up by the steam engine.</p>
<p>Only a few years later, in 1808, Christopher Colles, the New York engineer and pioneer in American transportation mapping, turned his attention to the construction of canals. Another lengthy title, this time taking up twenty-two lines, started with a general proposition: <a href="/waterways-cartography-part-1/1808-proposed-canal-new-york"><em>Proposal of a Design for the Promotion of the Interests of the United States of America, Extending Its Advantages to All Ranks and Conditions of Men</em></a>. The means for promoting these progressive, democratic interests were <em>Inland Navigable Communications of a New Construction and Mode</em>. It was a “self-evident truth” the author exclaimed “that extensive water communications are the highest improvement any country can receive.” But the expense of canals was more than Americans could bear. They were expensive to dig, especially in a land short of labor. The solution, in the Colles proposal, was to take advantage of the native forests and construct the canals out of wood, above ground.</p>
<p>In essence, Colles would cut a swath through the Great Forest, use the wood to build a superstructure like a long, narrow bathtub, employ windmills to keep it full of water, and then lay out lots along the elevated watercourse to be sold to help finance the project. Holland furnished an instructive example, but a canal made of wood would reduce the initial expense and make it easy to keep in good repair once the trough was drained for the winter. Speed of construction would provide a great advantage, boosting the value of the “town lots” available “which carried the privilege of a barge.” Brisk sales would advance the whole project, reducing the cost to finance the effort.</p>
<p>In addition to listing the advantages of such a canal to various segments of American society, Colles calculated the expenses and the profit to be gained from one mile of a timber canal after the sale of the land along its route. Figure A presented a cross section of the proposed canal, sketching its method of construction. An interesting fold out map showed the route for one such canal across New Jersey to connect New York City with Philadelphia.

<h3>Practical Beginnings</h3>
<p>It is doubtful if Colles made any profit from the sale of his book or the use of his ideas. But at the time of its publication Zadok Cramer, a bookseller and stationer in Pittsburgh, had published the fourth edition of his <em>The Navigator</em>, a guide to the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers that was becoming an American classic. The early editions of Cramer’s pamphlet did not contain maps, but beginning in 1805, it featured a series of crude woodcuts to show the main channel for the entire river route from Pittsburgh to New Orleans. These maps were different from canal maps because they pictured conditions as they were known to be, rather than how they could be improved. The plates focused on the present rather than envisioning a better future; they were realistic in nature in contrast to the optimism built into most canal maps. Note Cramer’s sheet on the falls of the Ohio at Louisville, for example (<a href="/waterways-cartography-part-1/1817-navigation-guide-for-inland-rivers#top">Focus Map 2</a>).</p>
<p>Victor Collot, the French traveler, drew a similar map of the same area in 1796 to point out “the shortest and surest way” to portage around the rapids or falls. In the previous decade Christopher Colles also drew up a plan for a canal at the newly founded Louisville, but he could not get support for his project. He even called on George Washington for help, but the general, who readily perceived the value of canals, turned his immediate attention to improving the Potomac rather than the Ohio River. Indeed, a succession of proposals addressed the obstruction to river traffic at Louisville, but funding could not be obtained until after the success of the Erie Canal, completed in 1825, had spread “canal fever” throughout the republic.</p>
<p>In fact, DeWitt Clinton, when travelling to Ohio in 1825 to turn the first shovel of dirt for the Ohio and Erie Canal, looked forward to the day when cargoes from New Orleans could be shipped up-river to Portsmouth, Ohio by steamboat, then across the Buckeye State by canal boat to Lake Erie where they could reach the New York Canal System, creating an all-water route from New Orleans to New York City. Hailed in the West as “the father of internal improvement,” the governor of the Empire State spent almost a month traveling around Ohio touting his plans. He may have disappointed his hosts by ratifying the choice of a Kentucky-side canal at Louisville, in large measure, it seems, because the southern bank was more suitable for steamboats coming upstream. At this time, the rapids usually had prevented steamboats fighting the current from reaching Cincinnati, Wheeling, and Pittsburgh. Steamboats in the 1820s, with the aid of a skillful pilot, could, however, run the rapids and proceed downstream.</p>
<p>Thus a careful reader of North American canal and waterways cartography of the early period needs to be aware of the development of steam navigation on inland waters. Flatboats and keelboats were primarily downstream craft and even steamboats faced formidable obstacles when moving upstream. Henry Shreve experimented with moving the steam engine up on the deck and out of the hold to permit a shallow draft, thus minimizing the dangers from snags and rapids. By the late 1820s, his success, primarily in upstream movement, turned the Western rivers into two-way navigation channels, making it necessary to read waterway maps with a new set of eyeglasses.</p>
<p>One also needed a new mindset, as demonstrated by DeWitt Clinton’s thoughts as he considered the way to improve navigation at the falls of the Ohio. He was thinking of rivers and canals as part of a national system with New York and New Orleans as the major terminals for a vast inland navigation system reaching from Tidewater to the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<h3>A National System</h3>
<p>Up to 1825 most canals and river improvements were shown on maps leading from point A to point B. They envisioned segments of a water-borne commerce rather than a complete voyage within a vast regional, national, and even global commercial system. The Erie Canal changed that mode of map reading, encouraging a Great Lakes and Great River to Great Ocean pattern of thought. A young French engineer immediately perceived the importance of the Erie Canal, not only to the United States, but to the scope of inland navigation projects throughout the Western World, especially in his native land.</p>
<p>In many ways the digging of the Erie Canal set off a cartographic transformation in the United States as well. Early canals had often been featured on state maps and, of course, had been the focus of a variety of cartographic efforts emphasizing individual projects. But with longer routes serving as important traffic arteries, the artificial waterways, both completed and proposed, emerged as important elements on general reference maps. When William Darby published <em>A Tour from the City of New York to Detroit</em> in 1819, he included a route map that featured a larger context. This fascinating sheet pictured the Atlantic Coast south to Cape Henry, all of the Great Lakes, the Ohio River Watershed, and the Upper Mississippi Valley from the Falls of St. Anthony to the mouth of the Ohio River. A broad line traced the boundaries of each watershed and the “Grand Canal” prominently appeared on the map even though it was only one-fourth of the way toward completion.</p>
<p>Born in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania in 1775, Darby became one of the most prominent geographers and cartographers of the Early National Period. He began his career as a cotton planter in Louisiana, but a series of personal tragedies sent him back to Pennsylvania where John Melish published his <em>Geographic Description of Louisiana</em> in 1816, the same year that he married Elizabeth, the sister of Benjamin and Henry S. Tanner who had became celebrated engravers and map publishers. John Melish used Darby’s map of Louisiana as the basis for his influential map of the United States issued in 1819. Darby also probably pushed his brother-in-law, Henry S. Tanner, to issue the classic transportation map of the United States in the Canal Era, (<a href="/waterways-cartography-part-1/1820-plan-and-profile-erie-canal#top">Focus Map 4</a>).</p>
<p>By the time Tanner’s elaborate wall map appeared in 1829, a variety of publishers had issued travel guides with maps to various states and regions of the United States. Darby participated in this movement as well, publishing his <em>Emigrants Guide to the West and Southwestern Territories</em> in 1818. Another notable example of this type of publication is <em>Pratt’s River and Railroad Guide with Illustrated Maps</em>. <a href="/waterways-cartography-part-1/1848-travel-guide-hudson">Focus Map 5</a> is the 1848 version. Here the spotlight is on the nation’s major rivers (think steamboats) with canals and railroads included as “connecting lines.” The focus would largely shift to railroads in the 1850s, but, at the same time, the general public gave increasing attention to the infrastructure of canals and waterways such as navigational aids, bridges, docks, harbors, and so on. The “Map of the Hudson River shewing location of proposed Dams and Jetties for Permanently Improving the Navigation of the Hudson River” by S. H. Sweets (1856, <a href="/waterways-cartography-part-1/1852-proposed-dams-and-jetties#top">Focus Map 6</a>) offers not only a prime example of this genre of map but also calls out the themes of betterment, improvement, and progress which would dominate engineering cartography for the next century and beyond.</p>
<p>The 1850s, United States’ “Crucial Decade” in political terms, also witnessed the emergence of the railroad as the major element in its internal transportation system. At first, in the 1830s, railroads were considered as simply adjuncts to rivers, waterways, and canals. But technological advances in steam engines, locomotives, rails, and various types of equipment rapidly overcame many of the drawbacks limiting rail service. When the Civil War broke out, neither the rails nor the waterways were effectively tied together into national systems. The disruption of commerce on the Mississippi River proved to be only one of several factors that tipped the scales during the war in favor of railroads.</p>
<p>At this time, the uncertainty about British intentions made cities on the Great Lakes, both in Canada and the United States, very conscious of their vulnerability to attack across the waters (<a href="/waterways-cartography-part-1/1862-canada-lakes-and-canals#top">Focus Map 7</a>). Canal interests stoked these fears and sought to capitalize on the situation. Thus, for example, advocates for canals and waterways in the United States pointed out the limitations of the interior waterborne defense system by noting that the gunboats on the Mississippi River were too large to bring up to the Great Lakes if the need should arise. In 1863, canal advocates staged a great Canal Convention in Chicago that attracted an estimated 5,000 delegates, the largest public meeting of citizens staged during the war years. As the threat of a British alliance with the Confederacy faded, so did the push for enlarging the canal network, especially in the midst of a severe war-time labor shortage.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Chicago Canal Convention should be kept in mind when viewing transportation maps in the post-Civil War era. As its delegates were gathering at the height of the conflict, the Hudson River Day Line started regularly scheduled service on what became the most celebrated steam navigation route in the nation, where passengers, maps in hand, observed the sights along the river’s banks until the middle of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>The departure of the Southern States from Congress at the outbreak of the Civil War helped tip the balance at the national level towards the support of railroads over waterways in the development of a continental transportation system. The Pacific Railroad Act of 1862 is often used as the talisman of this shift in emphasis, followed by land grants to support mainly Western lines. Another key indicator was the sweeping way Congress authorized eight bridges across the Mississippi River in 1866, followed by similar encouragement for railroads to cross the Ohio River. In hindsight a map reader can look at transportation maps produced during the Post-Civil War Era as the triumph of the rails, but at the time the trend was not necessarily so clear cut. In 1880 the Erie Canal reached its maximum use and in the 1870s and 1880s, leading transportation engineers pointed to many promising large-scale waterways projects developing abroad. (<a href="/waterways-cartography-part-2/1882-inland-canals#top">Focus Map 11</a>) The celebration of the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad in the United States was more than matched by ceremonies in the Old World hailing the opening of the Suez Canal in the very same year.</p>
<p>Although now seen as part of the “Lost Cause,” a long campaign (1865-1880) by the James River and Kanawha Canal Company to open up a Mid-American outlet to the sea by joining the Ohio and James Rivers produced some bold proposals backed by spectacular maps. When Matthew Fontaine Maury returned to the United States after escaping to Europe as a Confederate officer at the end of the Civil War, the world-renowned scientist accepted a position at the Virginia Military Institute. He also headed the Physical Survey of Virginia, an attempt to document the available resources of the hard-pressed state. Location stood in the top list of these advantages.</p>
<p>Hampton Roads, like San Francisco Bay on the opposite side of the continent, could hold all of the ocean-going ships then sailing the seas. The Transcontinental Railroad, then nearing completion, would soon link the two great harbors. Maury’s perspective, explained in a sustained argument and buttressed by a host of statistics, found graphic expression in two stunning maps. The pair might be considered the climax of American waterways cartography. One, focusing on North America, was a detail from the larger map, almost global in its vision.</p>
<p>Maury, although considered the father of the science of oceanography, here focused his attention on continental interiors. “The people of this country are building their great hive of human industry in the Mississippi valley,” he declared, “that is the heart of the nation, and is in fact becoming the real source and centre of wealth, power, and greatness.” (<em>Physical Survey of Virginia</em>, 1868, 54) His focus, of course, made inland waterways of utmost importance. But railroads carried equal import. Indeed, transportation corridors demanded both rails and canals in Maury’s analysis. “No great line of trade and travel can satisfy the requirements of the age or fully meet the demands of commerce, unless it combines transportation both by rail and water lines” (35).</p>
<p>Look at the Erie Canal, the <em>Survey</em> admonished, the New York Central Railroad runs side by side. “Neither would be complete without the other. Each is required to do the work that the other cannot perform. Each supplements the other.” (<em>Ibid</em>.) Thus, to complete the “Central Water Line,” the James River and Kanawha Canal needed to be enlarged and completed, but a double-track railroad should also trace their route. Then the promise of the Transcontinental Railroad could then be fulfilled.</p>
<p>To make his point, Maury drafted a large fold-out map extending from the Pacific Coast of North America, crossing the continent and the Atlantic Ocean to end in Central Europe. Titled “Steam Line between Norfolk and Flushing,” the map featured the two port cities Maury considered most strategically placed along the Great Water Line. The sprawling sheet showed the transportation networks on each continent, both water and rail, that served “the back country geographically tributary to each [city], and the internal improvements connected therewith.” The key for the map, dated 1868, considered the significant gaps in the grand route as unfinished projects, particularly railroads in the American West and South, as well as key canals between the Ohio River and Richmond and between the Tennessee River and Mobile Bay. A line arching across the country from Delaware Bay to Oregon marked points of equal distance between New York City and Norfolk according to the pictured transportation system, giving the great advantage to the latter by including Toledo, Chicago, and the entire Pacific Railroad in its hinterland. In Europe, a transcontinental system already existed in the Rhine-Main-Danube waterway and a web of railroads surrounding it.</p>
<p>Maury’s grand vision, which may have been politically and economically naïve at the time, started to fade from sight after his death on February 1, 1873. But the very next month, when the US Senate adjourned, its Select Committee on Transportation Routes to the Seaboard, chaired by Senator William Windom of Minnesota, decided to visit many of the key sites of Maury’s Great American Water Line. The report of this Windom Select Committee, dated April 24, 1874, could have reprinted Maury’s map to buttress its unanimous conclusion that “the most feasible and advantageous channels of commerce to be created or improved” were (1) the Mississippi River, (2) a continuous water-line from the Great River to New York City by way of the Great Lakes, (3) a route through the central tier of states from the Mississippi River via the Ohio River to the Tidewater Region of Virginia, and (4) a “Southern Route” utilizing the Tennessee River to reach the Gulf Coast. The simple map, dated 1872, accompanying Senator Windom’s Report (1874) does not refer to Maury’s work, which would have given it much more explanatory power. Instead, the bright hopes for the future expressed in the <em>Physical Survey of Virginia</em> came as a bullet condensed into one sentence in the federal report: “A vast area of the richest agricultural and mineral country in the world is directly tributary” to the Central Route “and only awaits reasonable facilities for transportation, to develop a commerce the magnitude of which it is difficult now to conceive.”</p>
<p>The Panic of 1873, which extended to a depression throughout the decade, suspended federal interest in transportation planning on a national level until the Progressive Era (<a href="/waterways-cartography-part-2/1908-freight-rates-inland">Focus Map 15</a>). In addition, a severe flood in 1877 damaged the entire length of the James River Canal. State funds patched up the waterway, but during the down time traffic shifted to rail, and in 1880 a railroad purchased the canal so that it could utilize the gentle slope of its towpath for a track-bed.</p>

<h3>New Approaches</h3>
<p>Meanwhile, technological changes kept pushing engineers to consider new approaches to inland waterways. In the case of coal, a steady increase in demand accompanied the growth of America’s cities and the expanding use of steam engines to run machines, power locomotives, and propel steamboats. Along the East Coast a regional system of canals developed to connect coal mines in Pennsylvania with their markets along the Atlantic Coast. In the 1840s steamboats on the inland waterways started to shift their fuel to coal from the once abundant wood available along riverbanks. Railroads then connected these new markets in the American interior to coalfields in the Appalachian Mountains and the Midwestern Basin. After the Civil War, the increased use of coal barges on the Ohio River spurred the Corps of Engineers to consider expanding its role in river navigation from removing snags and sandbars to maintaining the straight-line channels needed by the barge tows.</p>
<p>Charles Ellet, a respected engineer with wide experience in building canals, conducted a government survey of the Ohio River in 1850 and suggested using huge reservoirs to modulate the flow of the water, thereby reducing the twin threats of flooding and low water. Ellet died in a Civil War battle, but another study in 1866 recommended turning the stream into a series of pools created by newly developed wicket dams. In effect, this would turn the entire river into a canal, a measure Congress would not approve until 1910. In 1885, however, the Davis Island Lock and Dam, five miles downstream from Pittsburgh, became the first installment on the canalization of the Ohio River, a project completed in 1929.</p>
<p>Two decades later, when the system of forty-six locks proved to be too cumbersome for modern towboats, a new plan called for reducing the number of lockage sites to nineteen. Thus, as the twentieth century dawned, the new thinking called for changes in the way one should read waterways maps. Thomas J. Vivian’s 1894 map for the Census Bureau, based on 1890 data, for example, indicated all the navigable rivers of the nation divided into four categories based on the depth of their channels. (<a href="/waterways-cartography-part-2/1904-canals-ohio">Focus Map 14</a>) As the age of towpath canals drew to its close, the navigable rivers of the continent were being canalized in the interest of flood control and the generation of electric power, as well as navigation.</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, people seeking adventure and profit in the Yukon Gold Rush studied water routes and portages across Canada as possible “short-cuts” to the bonanza lodes (<a href="/waterways-cartography-part-2/1898-water-routes-yukon#top">Focus Map 12</a>). Meanwhile economists, historians, social scientists, folklorists, and others representing a host of diverse interests supported a variety of retrospective maps showing the old towpath canals that were gradually being abandoned. Each waterway had its defenders and a major issue of public policy asked whether the canals should be modernized and enlarged or discontinued as transportation facilities. In some instances, bold new canal construction projects were proposed, often to provide competition for existing rail routes in an effort to secure a fair price for shippers. <a href="/waterways-cartography-part-2/1904-canals-ohio#top">Focus Map 13</a>, showing the existing, abandoned, and proposed canals in the state of Ohio came out of such a public policy debate. At the same time, on the national level, the Progressive Movement called attention to the nation’s rivers and streams as great natural resources that needed to be preserved for future generations to use. The waterways agenda now extended beyond navigation to include not only flood control but also irrigation, conservation, recreation, and the generation of electric power.</p>
<p>The <em>Preliminary Report</em> of President Theodore Roosevelt’s Inland Waterways Commission in 1908 developed a series of maps to compare freight rates for comparable shipments by rail and water from a central point to surrounding destinations. (<a href="/waterways-cartography-part-2/1908-freight-rates-inland">Focus Map 15</a>) A careful study of these “rate maps” documented the economic distortions in the nation’s transportation system. Soon afterwards, the First World War would demonstrate “on the ground” as well as on the map the traffic crisis created by the logistics of supporting an Overseas Expeditionary Force. The war effort led the nation to think much more seriously about the national interest and federal investments in transportation facilities.</p>
<p>One aspect of this reawakened awareness was the nature and function of port facilities, not only on the ocean’s shores but also at key inland locations. By 1930 a series of twenty-two volumes had appeared describing the nation’s ocean ports, largely addressed to the general public. Harbors on the Great Lakes came next and those in the Mississippi River Valley soon followed. These publications featured flow-chart maps indicating the sources, destinations, and volumes of each major segment of a port’s receipts and shipments. Detailed harbor plans, aerial views, and site photographs added to the picture. Then each study committee listed improvements that were needed. (<a href="/waterways-cartography-part-2/1931-buffalo-great-lakes#top">Focus Map 16</a>)</p>
<p>At the same time the US Lake Survey was publishing a series of nautical charts of the Great Lakes and inland waterways to aid navigation. (Focus Maps <a href="/waterways-cartography-part-2/1936-us-lake-survey#top">17</a> and <a href="/waterways-cartography-part-2/1970-nautical-charts-illinois#top">18</a>) Similar to the charts provided by the federal government for coastal areas and the Intracoastal Waterway (<a href="/waterways-cartography-part-2/1949-intracoastal-waterway-nj#top">Focus Map 19</a>), these detailed navigation guides pointed to the greatly expanded role of the federal government in the production of nautical charts and navigation aids. The Progressive Movement in the early part of the twentieth century posited that the improvement of the nation’s water transportation resources was a key means to achieve the nation’s destiny. “It is our duty,” the Republican Party’s Platform proclaimed at the Chicago Convention of 1908, “to carry out systematic improvement upon a large and comprehensive plan, just to all portions of the country, of the waterways, harbors, and Great Lakes, whose natural adaptability to the increasing traffic of the land is one of the greatest gifts of a benign Providence.”</p>
<p>These themes also animated a number of private associations formed to lobby for constructing particular waterways. The Atlantic Deeper Waterways Association, for example, held its first convention in Philadelphia only a few weeks after the Presidential Election of 1908 sent William Howard Taft to the White House, supported by the Republican Party platform quoted above. In the lobbying effort, business people joined recreational interests and civic boosters in pushing for what became the Intracoastal Waterway. This organization immediately began to publish a magazine and held annual conventions until the 1950s, when it closed shop and declared its “Mission Accomplished.” An earlier group, the Michigan and Mississippi Canal Commission, formed in 1885, took several decades to achieve its particular objective, the Hennepin Canal. These advocacy groups made ample use of maps, usually simple in character and often derived from existing sources.</p>
<p>The Hennepin group, for instance, issued a large map of the eastern United States to show, in a bold colorful overprint, how their proposed canal would link the nation’s two great inland waterways: one connecting the Great Lakes to New York City and the other leading from the Mississippi River to New Orleans. On closer inspection, however, the base map they used was stock readily available from Rand, McNally and Company. It was actually a detailed railroad map of the area which omitted all canals. Thus the color for the water route across upstate New York had to follow the New York Central Railroad rather than the Erie Canal itself.</p>
<p>In hindsight, this 1885 wall map seems to be an embarrassment to its sponsors. Nevertheless, the commission eventually reached its objective, apparently using the funds saved on original cartography for use by the lobbyists. Their project, the Hennepin Canal, had a towpath but was mostly used by steam-powered tugs moving barges. It proved to be too small and inefficient, never reaching its potential because locks on both the Mississippi and Illinois Rivers were enlarged to permit the passage of barges much larger than the Hennepin could accommodate. The canal, however, used new methods of construction and was the first to construct its locks entirely of concrete, setting an important precedent for the Panama Canal, which was approved as a lock canal by Congress as the Hennepin was nearing completion.</p>
<p>Thus the Illinois project has been called “a canal both ahead of and behind its time.” This adage is also true of the Hennepin’s use by the public. From the very beginning local people used the Illinois Canal for recreational boating, fishing, picnicking, and hiking. One local YMCA even used it for swimming lessons. In 1948 it saw no commercial traffic. Although closed shortly thereafter, another advocacy group organized a “Save the Canal Drive” and Congress agreed to deed it to the state of Illinois for use as a park in 1970. Since then the old canal, like many others across the Eastern part of the country, has found new life as a recreational and educational resource. With the dawn of ecological awareness, people began to ask questions about what was lost when dams were built, rivers canalized, and watersheds modified for commercial reasons. All expenditures on waterways needed to be subject to a cost-benefit analysis, and, under public pressure, Congress required the Army Corps of Engineers to consider ecological issues when making future plans.</p>
<p>In the beginning cartographers viewed canals and waterways exclusively as transportation facilities. By the late twentieth century they also needed to consider a variety of additional cultural, ecological, and aesthetic considerations when making their maps. In many ways, map readers also transformed the old maps they were reading by bringing new mindsets to the communication process. These were often advanced by public interest organizations that played an increasing role in American life. Take the maps of the Tennessee Valley Authority as an example.</p>
<p>The Tennessee River Improvement Association, another private group lobbying for governmental support for particular projects to improve navigation, had roots dating back to 1877, but became a more influential voice after its reorganization in 1896. It achieved some success in building several dams but found a much more receptive audience in the New Deal’s concerns for addressing the widespread poverty in the region during the Great Depression. The generation of electric power probably moved ahead of navigation concerns when Congress established the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) in 1933. In subsequent years the TVA became a model for regional development and the achievement of multiple objectives through public works projects, especially waterways. Supporters of the TVA emphasized how improving the Tennessee River would fill in a gap in the nation’s waterway network, a point TVA authorities made in a striking map that was designed to indicate the broad reach of their waterway. Indeed, <a href="/waterways-cartography-part-2/1964-commodities#top">Focus Map 20</a> portrays no land. It pictures only waterways as routes and ports without banks or shores.</p>
<p>In contrast, Walter B. Langbein’s study of the <em>Hydrology and Environmental Aspects of the Erie Canal</em> (1976) included a cross section that featured the vegetation along the sides rather than the canal itself. In the same year, the report of the Great Lakes Basin Framework Study spelled out the “Factors of Water Supply to the Lakes” during the 1950s as a cross section in which the lakes as bodies of water almost disappear. As the focus of waterways cartography shifted toward ecological and recreational considerations, the maps included much more detailed portrayals of the riverine environment and facilities available along the waterway corridor. Some reports even suggested that traditional lock-and-pool canals should be replaced by free-flowing streams. Shoots, slides, and plunge pools would replace locks to accommodate recreational boating. These new portrayals did not replace the established traditions, but added new types of maps to the existing corpus.</p>

<h3>Meaning</h3>
<p>And so, as we approach the present day with all its conflicts, confusion, and cacophony and look back at the story of canals and waterways through the maps that fixed their places for us, we ask “What does this mean?” The slow pace of travel on their slack waters and languid pools tempts us to see bygone days as belonging to a different way of life. “Down by the old mill stream,” suggests a sense of loss or at least a way of life that faded away before modernity arrived. These thoughts came my way when I began this assignment. Looking at canal maps, I thought, would be relaxing, not too arduous, slow in nature like the waters themselves, arousing antiquarian interests, and bringing to mind a chapter in American life now lost. But nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
<p>In sum, water, then and now, is of the essence on canal maps; even more so when we consider the additional work the waters have been asked to do as waves of settlement have spread across the continent. We turned great rivers into canals themselves and sought ways to tame great lakes. If we read the twenty focus maps in this two-part essay with the deepest penetration we can muster, we will come back to a basic truth, so simple that it seems self-evident: Water stands at the heart of cartography, geography, history, and life itself.</p>
<p>Starting with this truism might be a stimulating way to begin reading any waterways map. Each example has a specific purpose to be sure, but when viewed as a tiny part of a large corpus of work, we begin to realize how even the most specialized map is also a broader cultural document, reflecting its place in time and space as it adds its bit to the common cultural heritage. Any map read in this way can serve as a widow to more than the specific geography lessons it was designed to teach. And that realization is the beginning of cartographic wisdom.</p>

<h4>Further Reading</h4>
<p>The previous discussion of canal and waterways maps is in some ways unique in that it employs their cartography to explore North American history, especially how inland waters carried passengers and freight back and forth across the continent as economic, political, social, and cultural functions. There are literally thousands of excellent books and articles that tell the story of virtually every canal, waterway, river, lake, inland port, and navigation system that has served the continent’s inhabitants. Maps have attended these studies in two ways: (1) as primary sources left behind after the planning, building, use, modification, and overall functioning of the particular facility and (2) as creations by later people who turned to cartography to narrate the tale or gauge the effectiveness of particular works, routes, or functions of these waterways.</p>
<p>From the very start scholars at various times have surveyed the major existing works and systems and described them in a systematic way. The entry on “Canals” in both the original British and subsequent American edition of the <em>Cyclopaedia</em> compiled by Abraham Rees serve this function on a global scale. George Armroyd’s <em>A Connected View of the Whole Internal Navigation of the United States</em> appeared in two editions, 1826 and 1830 (reprinted, 1971), needing over 600 pages to complete its coverage.</p>
<p>A major effort by the Division of Transportation of the Carnegie Institution of Washington in the early twentieth century led to several dozen studies by individual scholars which formed the base for a summary <em>History of Transportation in the United States before 1860</em> (1917) prepared under the direction of Balthasar Henry Meyer by Caroline E. MacGill and her staff. This landmark volume was reprinted in 1948. <em>The Preliminary Report of the Inland Waterways</em> <em>Commission</em> published by the Government Printing Office as a Senate Document in 1908 had a different function, but ranged widely in gathering background information of great use to later scholars. It was reprinted in 1972.</p>
<p>In contrast, to these lengthy tomes, most readers learned about <em>Old Towpaths: The Story of the American Canal Era</em> from the sprightly book by Alvin F. Harlow issued in 1926. It is a nostalgic account, ending in a lament for a world that lost out to “the neurotic whirl of our present-day business and social life.” Although it is comprehensive in its coverage, its usefulness is limited by the absence of notes and the lack of an index. Moreover, its tone has shaded the popular image of the canal era and suggested that waterways disappeared with the coming of the railroad. The cartographic record, of course, tells a different tale and one must convert to a divergent mindset to reap the full benefits of these maps.</p>
<p>Going further will be a do-it-yourself project for the researcher, but let me suggest eight reading assignments that might be useful in getting started. First, the researcher should use a survey of the Canal Era in the United States, 1790-1860 by a modern scholar such as Ronald E. Shaw’s <em>Canals for a Nation</em> (1990), a brief account that touches many topics and themes. The second and third suggestions are to read two books in tandem: Forest G. Hill, <em>Roads, Rails, &amp; Waterways: The Army Engineers and Early Transportation</em> (1957) and Arthur Maass, <em>Muddy Waters: The Army Engineers and the Nation’s Rivers</em> (1951). This would be best followed by a book or an article in the continuing debate between natural free-flow advocates and those confident in engineering solutions to riverine problems.</p>
<p>The fourth and fifth suggestions are to use some deeper history to illuminate the European context for America’s use of waterways as transportation arteries. The researcher would be well served to start with L. T.C. Rolt’s <em>From Sea to Sea: The Canal du Midi</em> (1973), then to read Chandra Mukerji’s, <em>Impossible Engineering</em> (2009), the same topic seen through several different lenses, and conclude with her article, “Printing, Cartography, and Conceptions of Place in Renaissance Europe,” in <em>Media, Culture, and Society</em>, 28:5 (September, 2006), 651-669.</p>
<p>The next two approaches involve much less arduous reading. The sixth, <em>Towpaths to Tugboats: A History of American Canal Engineering</em> (1985) is a pamphlet published by the American Canal and Transportation Center for a popular audience. It hails the achievements of the engineers as milestones on the road to progress. The other suggestion, the seventh, is a clearly written scientific study, <em>Hydrology and Environmental Aspects of Erie Canal (1817-99)</em>. The illustrations alone in this ninety-two-page report, US Geological Survey Water-Supply Paper number 2018, are worth the price of admission.</p>
<p>The eighth, and final, recommendation starts with Robert C. Post’s <em>Technology, Transport, and Travel in American History</em> (2003), a short volume in the Historical Perspectives on Technology, Society, and Culture series issued by the American Historical Association and the Society for the History of Technology. Three of its nine chapters deal with Canals, the Inland Seacoast, and Riverways. Brief essays, followed by several pages of useful notes are really a preface to a long bibliography.</p>
<p>In the end, going researching further depends on where one’s subject is planted. It will be necessary to use local sources and state or regional finding aids to discover materials of use. But one should not neglect general or related documents. Remember: Developing a context for the research will provide keys to its meaning and significance. Several of Post’s suggestions will probably be useful springboards, but I have my own favorites to add to his list:</p>

  return `<p>Migration, which is the process of people moving from one place to another in order to establish a new residence, has been a reoccurring theme in US history. The nature of this migration experience has a variety of temporal and geographical components which can be studied with maps. Some of the more important questions to address geographically include identifying homelands migrants have left, locating the places where they settled, and determining where and how they moved after they arrived in the North America. The reasons for people relocating into and within the United States have been numerous, but in most cases cannot be easily determined from the cartographic evidence.</p>
<p>This essay and the accompanying captioned maps identify and illustrate a variety of maps that can be used effectively to document the spatial components of the US migration story. Very few maps show actual migration patterns; however, maps often show roads, railroads, or other transportation routes that migrants could have used. Maps also capture a moment in time, providing a cross section of a geographical space that depicts the migrants’ homeland or place of origin, as well as their new home or place of eventual settlement. Some migrations are not well documented on contemporary maps, such as the African slave trade and the Underground Railroad; the Native Americans’ “trail of tears;” or the journeys of young women who moved to New England industrial towns from the nearby rural countryside. The selection of maps for this essay is not intended to be comprehensive; each immigrant group’s story is different. Rather the selection is based on my research which has focused on German-American and African-American experiences. For a general description of the geographical components of a wider variety of immigrant groups, please refer to the thematic maps and accompanying discussions found in <em>We the People</em> (Allen and Turner 1988).</p>

<h3>Migration Processes and Trends</h3>
<p>The United States is known as a nation of immigrants. One of the distinctive characteristics of its culture is the variety and vitality of its immigrant and ethnic composition. The nation was founded and grew as a result of migration, primarily from Europe, Africa, and East Asia during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, but also from other parts of the world in the twentieth century. Almost all Americans can claim to have some foreign ancestry, whether they are a first- or second-generation immigrant, or they can trace their ancestry to an earlier generation of immigrants.</p>
<p>Many immigrants came voluntarily or freely, making a conscious decision to migrate based on a variety of economic, political, or religious push-pull factors. The great majority of these sought better jobs and higher standards of living; others fled political oppression or situations of ethnic cleansing; while some desired to practice their religious beliefs more freely. The need to escape physical disasters, such as droughts or famines, motivated others to leave their homelands.</p>
<p>During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, most of the newly arriving colonists came from England, settling along the Atlantic seaboard and in the major port cities of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Charleston. While the British dominated the political and economic structure of the thirteen colonies, large numbers of Germans and Scotch Irish settled in southeastern Pennsylvania and the backcountry from Maryland south to the Carolinas (Lemon 1990).</p>
<p>However, the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, particularly from about 1840 to 1920, was the period of mass migration from Europe to the United States. During this time period, the nation’s population grew from 17 to 105 million, a sixfold increase. Although there was a high rate of natural increase with birth rates exceeding death rates, 33 million immigrants came into the country during this time span. After 1924, when entry restrictions were instituted with the enactment of the National Origins Act, the number of new immigrants declined noticeably (Ward 1990).</p>
<p>From 1840 to 1880, the largest number of immigrants came from Northwest Europe, particularly Germany and Ireland, with smaller numbers from England, France, and Scandinavia. The Germans settled in both rural and urban settings primarily in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwestern states, while the Irish settled in urban and industrial communities primarily in the Northeastern states. Both avoided the South primarily because of their antipathy toward slavery and the lack of industrial jobs in the southern economy.</p>
<p>After 1880, the source regions changed drastically. Although the number of German, Irish, English and Scandinavian immigrants remained high, their numbers were surpassed by immigrants from Italy, Greece, and lands ruled by the Austrian-Hungarian and Russian empires. These immigrants tended to settle in the larger cities in the Northeastern, Mid-Atlantic, and Midwestern states.</p>
<p>Throughout the last two thirds of the nineteenth century, there was also a sizeable flow of immigrants from Asia, particularly from China, to the West Coast of the United States. Numbering about one million, the Asian immigrants worked primarily on railroad construction and in the mining communities of the West.</p>
<p>For others, however, their migration was involuntary or forced. The two primary examples of forced migration within the American experience are the Native and African Americans. As Europeans colonized eastern North America and their settlement frontier expanded across the Appalachians, Native Americans were pushed further west and confined to reservations, first in the Midwest, then the Great Plains and the West, through a succession of negative pressures including disease, battles, treaty negotiations, and land cessions. African Americans, on the other hand, were the victims of the seventeenth and eighteenth century slave trade. Many of the Africans who were sold into slavery came from the West Coast of Africa, where they were imported to West Indian sugar plantations, before re-export to the southeastern United States. Within the United States, the Africans’ movements were tied to the migrations of their owners until their eventual emancipation following the Civil War.</p>
<p>In addition to the migrations into the United States from Europe, Africa, and Asia, there was considerable migration within the United States. One major trend was the general movement of the settlement frontier westward across the United States. With the signing of the Paris Peace treaty in 1783, the new nation gained control of the lands east of the Mississippi River. Settlement moved rapidly from the eastern states across the Appalachian Mountains into the Old Northwest and the Southeast, as these public domain lands were systematically surveyed and subsequently sold as part of the General Land Office’s iconic township and range system (Grim 1990). This east to west migration tended to occur in broad latitudinal bands, with migrants from New England and the Mid-Atlantic states moving into the Upper Midwest, those from the Chesapeake region moving into the Lower Midwest and the Upper South, and those from the Carolinas and Georgia moving into the Lower Southeast.</p>
<p>With the purchase of the Louisiana Territory in 1803, the spirit of Manifest Destiny spurred the further acquisition and settlement of the lands west of the Mississippi. By adding Texas, the Mexican Southwest and the Pacific Northwest, the national territory extended as far as the Pacific Ocean by the middle of the nineteenth century. The discovery of gold in California and the construction of transcontinental railroads hastened migration to the West Coast, whether it was long-time residents of the older eastern states or newly arrived immigrants from Europe, China, or Mexico.</p>
<p>Industrialization in the early nineteenth century encouraged a rural to urban migration trend within the United States. With employment opportunities developing in the new industrial towns of New England, young women from rural communities along with French Canadians moved into such towns as Lowell and Lawrence. As industrialization spread through the Mid-Atlantic and Midwestern cities, rural to urban migration increased rapidly. Following the Civil War, many emancipated slaves remained in the South, but others started to move to northward to urban and industrial centers in the Northeast and Midwest, a trend that greatly accelerated during the first half of the twentieth century. From 1840 to 1920 the urban population of the United States increased from eleven to fifty-one percent of the total US population. This dramatic increase can be attributed to both foreign immigration and rural to urban migration.</p>

<h3>Personal Accounts of Migration</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, there are very few maps that were compiled or published during the eighteenth, nineteenth, and early twentieth centuries that document individual migration stories or the general geographical patterns of migration into and within the United States. What we know about the geographical components of this migration process, we have learned from millions of personal stories, which can be plotted on and documented with a wide variety of maps published during this period. Diaries, letters, and family genealogies provide the basis for reconstructing numerous personal migration routes, from which historians have been able to determine general patterns.</p>
<p>One example of a personal narrative that is particularly useful for identifying geographic locations and travel routes is an account prepared by John Parkinson, a young man from the lead mining region of southwestern Wisconsin. In this biographical account, which was published in a 1921 issue of the <em>Wisconsin Magazine of History</em> (Parkinson 1921), he focused on his relocation from Wisconsin to the California Gold Fields during the 1850s, but also described the geographic origins of his family before they settled in Wisconsin.</p>
<p>This young twenty-year-old did not prepare any maps of his journeys, but he did make specific mention in his account regarding the modes of transportation and general routes that he followed between destinations representing various legs of his three-year journey. He and three other men were outfitted with two wagons and eight oxen by Parkinson’s father. This team left southwestern Wisconsin, May 3, 1852. They crossed the Mississippi River at Dubuque, and traversed Iowa via Cedar Rapids and Des Moines. After crossing the Missouri River, they travelled through Nebraska paralleling the north side of the Platte River to South Pass, where they selected the emigrant road to California. On this leg of the trek, they crossed the Green and Bear Rivers, passed north of Great Salt Lake, traversed the Great Basin and Sierra Nevada Range, and arrived at the Sacramento River, October 11, five months after they left home.</p>
<p>After three years of prospecting for gold at various mining camps in Northern California, Parkinson decided to return to Wisconsin to continue his college education. Rather than retrace the arduous overland journey, he decided to return by sea, crossing the continent at the Isthmus of Nicaragua. This return journey employed a number of different modes of transportation. It consisted of traveling by wagon to Shasta City, stagecoach and boat down the Sacramento River to San Francisco, steamer south along the Pacific Coast to Nicaragua, wagon and steam boat across the Isthmus and Lake Nicaragua, steamer from Greytown to New York City, train from New York to Chicago and then Freeport, and finally by stagecoach to home. Parkinson noted that the return trip took three weeks, but he also remarked that when he took a similar trip to California with his family fifty years later by train, it took only four days.</p>
<p>We also learn from Parkinson’s account the basic components of his family’s geographic origins and movements. His father’s family was English, settling first in Virginia and then moving to Tennessee and eventually Illinois. His mother’s family was Scotch-Irish Presbyterian, coming from Northern Ireland and settling initially in North Carolina. They subsequently moved to southern Illinois, where his parents met in 1817. His parents were encouraged by a relative to move to southwestern Wisconsin to take advantage of the mining opportunities and wheat farming. This short synopsis reinforces general migration trends that historians have noted during the eighteenth century when the primary immigrants were English, Scotch Irish, and German, and during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, when migration from the original thirteen colonies trended westward in broad latitudinal bands.</p>
<p>Using some of the maps described in this essay, as well as those described in other sections of the Mapping Movement portal, it would be possible to plot a fairly accurate geographical outline of Parkinson’s three-year adventure in the Gold Fields, and to trace the movements related to his family’s genealogy. Some of these maps would include those showing the initial wagon roads from the Midwest to California (<a href="/mapping-migration/1849-route-california#top">Caption 4</a>); maps of the early road and railroad networks in the eastern part of the United States (<a href="/mapping-migration/1843-northwestern-states#top">Caption 3</a>); statistical maps and atlases that depict general population and immigration trends (<a href="/mapping-migration/1898-statistical-atlas-us#top">Caption 6</a>); and landownership maps and atlases that record mid-nineteenth century settlement patterns in the Midwest (<a href="/mapping-migration/1886-plat-book-clayton">Caption 9</a>).</p>
<p>While personal narratives have rarely been mapped collectively, one exception is the initial attempt during the 1890s, as well as subsequent twentieth century revisions, to reconstruct maps of the various routes associated with the African American slaves’ escape to freedom on the Underground Railroad. These maps were based on the accounts of abolitionists and escaping slaves (<a href="/mapping-migration/1898-underground-railroad-routes#top">Caption 1</a>).</p>

<h3>Maps of Migration</h3>
<p>If personal narratives of individual family migration histories, such as Parkinson’s memoir, are not accompanied by illustrative maps, how can we map the migration process? Fortunately, the three fundamental geographical components of migration into and within the United States can be studied cartographically. These cartographic sources include maps of the migrant’s homeland or place of origin, the general paths or specific routes that the migrants travelled, and maps of the places the migrants settled, whether these are thematic maps or large-scale maps of rural or urban settings showing the name of individual landowners. While these maps are not dynamic in allowing us to observe the entire process, they provide static snapshots of specific stages or steps within the process.</p>
<h4>Homeland Maps</h4>
<p>For many Americans with European ancestry, locating the specific town or village from which their ancestors migrated is an important part of their genealogical research. Small- and moderate-scale maps showing major cities and towns, as well as the primary transportation networks, were published for most European countries during the eighteenth century. Maps of this nature are readily available in numerous American map libraries that have good historic collections of single sheets maps and world atlases. During the nineteenth century, larger scale topographic map series were published for many European countries, first for France, England, the Low Countries, and later for Scotland, Ireland, Switzerland, Germany, the Austrian-Hungarian Empire, Poland, and Russia (Larsgaard 1993). With the aid of contemporary gazetteers, geographic names databases (see Further Reading) and more specialized gazetteers, such as <em>Where Once We Walked</em> (Mokotoff and Sack 2002), which provides a listing of Jewish Shtetls in eastern and central Europe, researchers can locate most cities, towns, and small villages throughout Europe (USGS 1991).</p>
<h4>Transportation and Promotional Maps</h4>
<p>In determining how immigrants arrived at their new locations, researchers would like to know about their trans-Atlantic voyages, the port cities where they entered the country, and the routes they travelled throughout the country to reach their final destination. While only scattered maps showing specific voyages or the general course of trans-Atlantic routes are available for the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, there are numerous maps of the nation or individual states that show ports of entry and assist in tracing routes described in personal narratives. National or state maps published during the last half of the eighteenth century generally show only the major roads, but similar maps published after the introduction of internal improvements during the first half of the nineteenth century distinguish between turnpikes, post roads, canals and railroads. And in many cases there are also maps of individual canal or rail routes as they were planned, constructed, and promoted, as discussed in other sections of this portal (Grim 2000).</p>
<p>One specific type of map, particularly those published to accompany or illustrate promotional travel literature, selected or reinterpreted more detailed reference and transportation maps to address specific immigrant populations. For example, the guidebooks intended to promote German immigration were written in German, and the maps were translated into German. In some cases, the selection of towns and communities displayed on the map reflect a German bias. The geographical coverage of these guidebooks and maps varied. Some, such as Traugott Bromme’s advice book for German emigrants, provided a general discussion of emigration from Germany to various locations around the world, although there is a decided emphasis on various regions within North America (<a href="/mapping-migration/1846-german-immigration">Caption 2</a>). Besides including small general maps pairing most of the states, he included maps of the major port cities on the northeast coast, showing immigrants where they would most likely disembark. Francis Grund’s handbook (<a href="/mapping-migration/1843-northwestern-states#top">Caption 3</a>) is more focused geographically, promoting migration to the Midwestern states, while Joseph Ware’s emigrant guide to California (<a href="/mapping-migration/1849-route-california#top">Caption 4</a>), highlights and maps a single route of migration, most likely the one followed by John Parkinson, whose personal memoir is illustrated above.</p>

<h4>Thematic and Statistical Maps</h4>
<p>Thematic maps, based on census data and immigration statistics, are the best graphics for visualizing where immigrants were born and where they settled. Unfortunately, such maps began to be published in the United States only during the middle of the nineteenth century, following the US censuses of 1860 and 1870. Although federal population censuses were taken every ten years beginning in 1790, place of birth was not recorded until 1850. Demographic data, such as this, was not mapped until 1860, when the slave population in the southern states was the first demographic variable to be mapped (Schulten 2011; <a href="/mapping-migration/1863-slave-populations#top">Caption 5</a>). Starting with the 1870, 1880, and 1890 censuses, the US Census Bureau, along with a commercial publisher, issued three statistical atlases that employed a number of creative graphic devices to display information about the nation’s growing immigrant population (Dahmann; <a href="/mapping-migration/1898-statistical-atlas-us#top">Caption 6</a>).</p>
<p>The Census Bureau continued to publish statistical atlases for the 1900, 1910, and 1920 censuses. However, the maps were less attractive and less creative, and the Bureau failed to produce similar publications for succeeding censuses. However, this void in providing cartographic and visual interpretation of census data was taken up by academic and professional cartographers, particularly as they prepared national and state atlases during the late twentieth century. For example, two geography professors at California State University, Northridge, published <em>We the People: An Atlas of Ethnic Diversity</em> (Allen and Turner 1988) which was based on data collected during the 1980 census from a controlled sample asking respondents what they considered their primary national ancestry. The atlas contains numerous thematic maps, showing ancestry for sixty-seven national or ethnic groups. Another example is the <em>Historical Atlas of Massachusetts</em> (Halpern and Wilkie 1991). The chapter on immigration includes innovative cartograms showing the size of ethnic population in counties and towns throughout Massachusetts.</p>
<p>While most cartographic representations of immigration statistics have been prepared as national or state maps, there are a few examples of studies that focused on individual cities, or portions of cities. One example is a survey of one of the poorest section of Chicago, based on a study conducted by residents of Jane Addams Hull House in the early 1890s (<a href="/mapping-migration/1895-nationalities-chicago">Caption 7</a>). These colorful maps depict the percentage of each immigrant group living in individual structures within the study area.</p>
<h4>Large-Scale Settlement Maps</h4>
<p>Thematic maps are very useful for identifying the heaviest densities or largest concentrations of individual immigrant groups within the nation or in an individual state. However, there are other moderate- to large-scale maps that help enhance our understanding of general migration trends or immigrant settlement patterns.</p>
<p>For example, state sectional maps, such as the one used to illustrate migration into Kansas during the 1850s (<a href="/mapping-migration/1856-eastern-kansas#top">Caption 8</a>), illustrate several trends. State sectional maps, which were prepared for most Midwestern and Great Plains states, show the progress of General Land Office surveys for the year in which they were published. Thus, by viewing a chronological succession of these maps for an individual state such as Kansas, it is possible to demonstrate how rapidly the settlement frontier was moving through the state, generally in a westerly direction. In addition the sample map of Kansas also identifies the emigrant roads to California and Oregon providing further evidence of this westward migration trend. On the other hand, the distinct delineation on this map of the lands reserved for Native Americans illustrates their removal from eastern tribal lands to the Great Plains and eventually to the Indian Territory. More subtle clues, such as marginal illustrations and the location of specific events, provide evidence of the conflicts between the pro- and antislavery groups settling in Kansas after the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1850.</p>
<p>Large-scale landownership maps are useful for examining immigrant settlement patterns in rural areas. Such maps, showing the names of individual landowners, were first published during the 1790s for a number of New England towns. Similar maps were published at the county level during the first decades of the nineteenth century, and became very prevalent for most counties in the New England and Mid-Atlantic states by the 1850s. Published as large wall maps, they displayed the names of individual property owners, and located churches, schools, public buildings, and factories. They were often illustrated with vignettes of the homes or businesses of the map’s patrons (Stephenson 1967; Conzen 1990). Following the Civil War, land ownership maps were published in an atlas format for many counties in the Midwestern and Great Plain states (LeGear 1950). These atlas maps also showed the names of individual landowners, and located churches, schools, and factories. The atlases often included a picture section and business directory, helping to identify the wealthier and more prominent citizens of the county. By locating the churches, which were often named according to their immigrant affiliation and by comparing family surnames with manuscript census schedules, it is possible to identify clusters of immigrant settlers, as demonstrated for the German settlement in and near Guttenberg, Iowa (<a href="/mapping-migration/1886-plat-book-clayton">Caption 9</a>).</p>
<p>The visual identification of such population clusters on cartographic sources can be confirmed by an analysis of the associated manuscript census schedules from the United States decennial population censuses. Beginning in 1850, these schedules listed the place of birth for each individual and for both parents beginning in 1880. The manuscript census schedules are maintained by the US National Archives and Records Administration as part of the records of the Bureau of the Census (Record Group 29: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201024184520/http://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/029.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/029.html</a>). Microfilm copies of these census schedules are available at NARA regional facilities and at many libraries throughout the country. These schedules can also be accessed online through subscription data bases such as Heritage Quest Online (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201024184520/http://www.heritagequestonline.com/hqoweb/library/do/login" rel="nofollow">http://www.heritagequestonline.com/hqoweb/library/do/login</a>) or free data bases such as Family Search (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201024184520/https://familysearch.org/" rel="nofollow">https://familysearch.org/</a>). For example, the manuscript census schedules for Guttenberg, Iowa, are reproduced in NARA microfilm publication T9, roll 0333 (1880, Iowa, Clayton County, Guttenberg, ED 137, sheets 407-418). For this research, the Guttenberg schedules were accessed through Family Search.</p>
<p>Fire insurance and real estate atlases provide a similar resource for identifying immigrant neighborhoods in urban settings. First published for major cities, such as New York City, Chicago, and Boston in the 1860s, these urban atlases became standard publications for most major cities and towns during the second half of the nineteenth century, and continued to be updated and revised until the middle of the twentieth century. Fire insurance atlases, which were prepared to assist insurance underwriters in determining risk assessment, showed the footprint of individual buildings which were color coded to reflect their construction material (yellow for wood or frame structures, pink for brick, and blue for stone). Churches, schools, major public buildings, and factories were labeled (LOC 1981; Karrow and Grim 1990). Real estate atlases served a similar function for real estate agents and included similar information, although most included the names of residential property owners. Again, by locating churches and other social organizations that are associated with specific immigrant groups and by comparing the family surnames on the map sheets with those listed in contemporary city directories or manuscript census schedules, it is possible to identify immigrant neighborhoods, as demonstrated for a major German neighborhood in Chicago using an 1886 real estate atlas (<a href="/mapping-migration/1886-fire-insurance-chi#top">Caption 10</a>). It is also interesting to note that maps from a fire insurance atlas were used as base maps to plot the data collected for the Hull House maps (<a href="/mapping-migration/1895-nationalities-chicago#top">Caption 7</a>).</p>

<h3>Further Reading</h3>
<p>While little has been written specifically about the mapping of migration and immigrant settlement, there are many historical and geographical studies that discuss general migration trends, as well as the migration histories of individual immirant groups. Good summaries of the geographical components of the migration process to and within the United States are found in two essays by historical geographers James T. Lemon, “Colonial America in the Eighteenth Century,” and David Ward, “Population Growth, Migration and Urbanization, 1860-1920,” both published in North America: <em>The Historical Geography of a Changing Continent</em>, edited by Robert D. Mitchell and Paul A. Groves (Savage, MD, 1990; revised 2001). Another overview of the migration process within the context of 500 years of the settlement history of the United States is provided by historical geographer Donald Meinig in his four-volume work, <em>The Shaping of America</em> (New Haven, 1986-1998). Throughout this geographically-focused interpretation, Meinig devotes separate discussions, illustrated with innovative graphics, to such topics as migration and the slave trade during the colonial period (“Migration and Change: Europeans Overseas” and “Enslavement and Change: Africans in America,” vol. 1, 213-231); westward migration and the removal of the Indians during the first half of the nineteenth century (“Shoving the Indians Out of the Way,” and “Filling in the Framework: Migration Westward,” vol. 2, 78-103, 222-236); or the massive European immigration during the second half of the nineteenth century (“Population and People,” vol. 3, 265-293, 432-434). Each discussion is accompanied by bibliographic citations referencing key studies by historians and geographers.</p>
<p>In addition to bibliographic resources listed by Meinig, another excellent starting point for researching the geographical distribution and migration history of individual national or ethnic groups is James Paul Allen and Eugene James Turner’s <em>We the People: An Atlas of American Ethnicity</em> (New York, 1988), which provides 115 maps and graphs depicting and analyzing ancestry data collected during the 1980 Federal census. Similar statistical maps and graphs which were published in atlases based on the 1870, 1880, and 1890 censuses are discussed by Donald C. Dahmann in “Presenting the Nation’s Cultural Geography,” Library of Congress, American Memory, Map Collections, Cultural Landscapes, online at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201024184520/http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/gmdhtml/census2.html" rel="nofollow">http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/gmdhtml/census2.html</a>. Digital copies of the 1870, 1880, and 1890 statistical atlases are also available at this site.</p>
<p>As outlined in the essay above, it is important to locate maps depicting the various stages in an individual family’s migration story in order to appreciate the broader trends of a particular immigrant group. In many ways, this type of research relies on methods and resources used by genealogists in researching their family histories. An introduction to the use of maps in genealogical research is found in the US Geological Survey’s small pamphlet, <em>Maps Can Help You Trace Your Family Tree: How to Use Maps in Genealogy</em> (Washington, DC, 1990, 1994), now available online at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201024184520/https://www.census.gov/history/pdf/mapsgenealogy.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://www.census.gov/history/pdf/mapsgenealogy.pdf</a>.</p>
<p>Place name research is a fundamental step in attempting to locate a migrant’s homeland or subsequent settlement locations. Two online databases maintained by the US Board on Geographic Names provide comprehensive listings of places names in the United States (US Board on Geographic Names Domestic Names data base, (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201024184520/http://geonames.usgs.gov/domestic/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://geonames.usgs.gov/domestic/index.html</a>) and foreign countries (US Board on Geographic Names Foreign Names data base, <a href="http://geonames.usgs.gov/foreign/" rel="nofollow">http://geonames.usgs.gov/foreign/</a>). Because of changing European boundaries during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, researchers also need to consult contemporary atlases and gazetteers, or more specialized data bases, such as JewishGen Gazetteer (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201024184520/http://www.jewishgen.org/Communities/LocTown.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.jewishgen.org/Communities/LocTown.asp</a>), which provides references to Jewish settlements in eastern and central Europe, or GeoTWAIN 2.0 (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201024184520/http://geotwain.rigeo.net/" rel="nofollow">http://geotwain.rigeo.net</a>), a valuable place name resource that integrates several historic gazetteers and databases including a comprehensive data set of German toponyms in the American Midwest. Examples of eighteenth and nineteenth century general reference maps of selected countries that could be used in conjunction with these place names searches are illustrated on the Leventhal Map Center’s virtual exhibition, Faces and Places Boston (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201024184520/http://maps.bpl.org/faces_and_places#tour" rel="nofollow">http://maps.bpl.org/faces_and_places#tour</a>). This exhibition, which focused on the homeland or source regions for immigrants living in Boston, illustrates eight European, Asian, and Latin American countries that contributed the largest number of immigrants to Boston, based on the 2000 census.</p>
<p>Another crucial step in tracing the movement of migrants is locating large-scale maps that depict the localities where they settled. Good, succinct descriptions of such maps can be found in essays by Michael P. Conzen, “North American County Maps and Atlases;” Gerald Danzer, “City Maps and Plans;” Ronald E. Grim, “Maps of the Township and Range System;” and Robert Karrow and Ronald E. Grim, “Two Examples of Thematic Maps: Civil War and Fire Insurance Maps,” all published in <em>From Sea Charts to Satellite Images: Interpreting North American History through Maps</em>, edited by David Buisseret (Chicago, 1990). Listings of county landownership maps and atlases, which are useful for researching rural areas, can be found in Richard W. Stephenson, <em>Land Ownership Maps: A Checklist of Nineteenth Century United States County Maps in the Library of Congress</em>. (Washington, DC, 1967) and Clara Egli LeGear, <em>United States Atlases: A List of National, State, County, City, and Regional Atlases in the Library of Congress and Co-operating Libraries</em> (Washington, 1950-1953). While the later bibliography also lists atlases for many of the country’s largest cities, another key resource for researching urban settlements are fire insurance maps. These are described and listed in <em>Fire Insurance Maps in the Library of Congress: Plans of North American Cities and Towns Produced by the Sanborn Map Company, Compiled by the Reference and Bibliography Section in the Geography and Map Division at the Library of Congress, with an Introduction by Walter W. Ristow</em> (Washington, DC, 1981). This comprehensive collection of Sanborn fire insurance maps is in the process of being digitized and can be viewed online at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201024184520/http://www.loc.gov/rr/geogmap/sanborn" rel="nofollow">http://www.loc.gov/rr/geogmap/sanborn</a>/.</p>

  return `<p>Mapping movement is a central theme in the texts of canonical as well as lesser known works taught today in classes on “American Literature.” From Christopher Columbus’s letters reporting on his first voyage (1493) to William Byrd’s <em>History of the Dividing Line</em> (ca.1728), from allegorical journey’s such as Mark Twain’s <em>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</em> (1884) to road novels like Jack Kerouac’s <em>On the Road</em> (1957), authors created elaborate word maps when tracking personal experiences or fictional characters, settings, and spatial actions. In order to make sense of such literary mappings critical studies have long pursued micro-analytical approaches delving into word use, etymology, and poetics; or, they applied macro-analytical approaches exploring the history of narrative form, literary genre, and the role of the literary marketplace. From studies addressing matters of geographic and social mobility we have learned over time to think about American poems, short stories, plays, and novels as cartographically inflected literary proving grounds where American writers explored the trope of the heroic quest, the sentimental journey, the utopian/dystopian frontier tale, and the aesthetics as well as politics informing the feelings and actions of traveling figures that included the hunter, the emigrant, and the runaway slave next to the man or woman of leisure, the working fathers and mothers, and the modern figure of the child (Franklin 1979; Lawson-Peebles 1988; Jehlen 1994; Buell 1995; Hsu 2010).</p>
<p>In these approaches it is a frequent observation that the representational qualities of maps—for example, the Appolonian gaze or “God view,” the scaled symmetry of spatial relationships, the rhetorical power of surveillance—have over the centuries informed the style of American literature in general and the literary representation of movement in particular. It has often been noted that in early American texts cartographic inserts served as organizing elements informing contact narratives and colonial histories, such as Captain John Smith’s <em>The Generall</em> <em>Historie of Virginia</em> (1624) or Cotton Mather’s ecclesiastical tome and hagiography, <em>Magnalia Christi Americana</em> (1702). Or, that maps or map-like drawings provided at once the literal and figurative plot for travel accounts from <em>The Discoveries of John Lederer</em> (1672), to Andrew Burnaby’s <em>Travels</em> <em>through the middle settlements in North-America, in the Year 1759 and 1760</em> (1775), to Timothy Flint’s <em>Recollections of the Last Ten Years, Passed in Occasional Residences and Journeyings in the Valley of the Mississippi</em> (1826).</p>
<p>It has also been frequently noted that between the eighteenth and twentieth centuries many United States authors had written their works with a map in hand: James Fenimore Cooper’s <em>The Pioneers</em> (1823) and <em>The Chainbearer</em> (1845) abound with references to his father’s archive of land surveyor’s plats; Herman Melville’s novels <em>Redburn</em> (1849) or <em>Moby Dick</em> (1851) were composed while the author consulted atlas maps and geography handbooks published by Jesse Olney; Edgar Allan Poe’s <em>The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym</em> (1838) provides specific geographical coordinates for navigating the South Pole; and Henry David Thoreau’s <em>Walden</em> (1854) offers an intricate metaphor of national identity by meshing language, literary form, and the graphic outline of Walden Pond. Similarly, if we fast-forward, maps appended works as different as Faulkner’s psychological novel, <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> (1936) or John Steinbeck’s travelogue, <em>Travels with Charley</em> (1962). Maps posed as the referential framework in poetry as different as Walt Whitman’s <em>Leaves of Grass</em> (1855) and Elizabeth Bishop’s <em>Trial Balances</em> (1935) and <em>Geography III</em> (1976). And last but not least, maps were frequently present in the endpapers of American fantasy and action novels, such as Frank Baum’s <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> (1900) or Dan Brown’s illustrated edition of <em>Angels &amp; Demons</em> (2006).</p>

<p>As new scholarship in areas ranging from reader response studies to GIS-supported textual analysis has shown, the figure of the map—as verbal imitation, direct citation, or material insert—had a profound influence on the production and reception of American literature. Literary mappings that had been deemed to be metaphorical adaptations in American texts turn out to be well-rehearsed transcriptions of particular maps (Padrón 2004; Brückner 2006). Allusions to map genres, such as New World maps, became a standard reference for the way in which early modern authors envisioned unknown lands, processed the colonization of a vast continental expanse and numerous peoples, or reconciled personal desire for property with communal rules of ownership (Pagden 1994; Buell 1995; Newman 2012). Beginning in the late eighteenth-century, the growth of carto-literacy among authors and readers aligned even the most casual literary map reference with complex discursive patterns of power and reconnaissance, invoking narratological or poetic conventions that described, for example, dramatic action, points of view, the geographical architecture of settings, and above all the idea of subjective and social mobility (Muehrcke 1974; Anderson 1991; Turchi 2007; Padron 2007; Moretti 1995; Cooper and Gregory 2011; Wilkens 2013).</p>
<p>Guided by the critical approach of “literary cartography,” this essay examines the factor of movement in relation to actual maps that were published along with select prose writings that are today considered representative examples of the American literary canon. It takes its cue from two developments: first, since the 1980s literary historians have increasingly recognized maps as an important paratextual component of American literary culture, supplementing not only a wide range of fiction and nonfiction works but the very genre of the magisterial literary survey. Second, during the same decades that had literary historians debate the definition of the American canon, historians of cartography debated conventional map definitions, increasingly accepting maps as a intermedial construct tapping graphic, verbal, and performative modes of representation. Today, it is fair to say that major anthologies have not only redefined American literature in much broader and more inclusionary terms, but have now incorporated the occasional historical map along with personal letters, political pamphlets, poems, plays, and novels (Bercovitch 1994; Lauter 1984; Baym 1989; Jehlen and Warner 1996).</p>
<p>While map inserts are generally treated as illustrative contexts rather than texts, this essay builds on a bibliographic survey of “American” literature published between 1600 and 2000 which revealed that physical maps were a regular insert in diverse literary genres, especially in travel writing, didactic nonfiction (in particular when addressing immigrants), and fiction addressing children. Because mobility was central to genres like these, the essay explores the trope of movement broadly as an intermedial dialogue between literary text and cartographic paratext. To accomplish this, its primary goal is to offer a provisional (and thus not comprehensive) survey of nonfiction and fictional prose writings that either carried printed maps inside their pages and bindings or that are demonstrably informed by a specific map-text nexus. While territoriality, distance reading, and spatial thinking ostensibly inform all maps, be they graphic or literary in kind, the essay examines patterns of mobility that are mostly located at the intersection of a dialogic imagination with the goal of linking the map as the textual tool providing orientation and direction to various literary forms and readerly functions.</p>
<p>Last but not least, in order to describe the relationship between maps and movement as a mutually constitutive part of American literary history the essay borrows from conventional models of periodization and geography. Three sections track popular literary genres across different, at times overlapping, periods defined by popular anthologies of American literature published in the English language (<em>Norton</em>; <em>Heath</em>), addressing writings that tend to be by and large commensurate with the North American continent, including the Caribbean Basin, and the United States territory. The three sections are: “Maps in the literature of colonization,” “Maps in the literature of nation formation,” and “Maps in the literature of two Gilded Ages, 1900/2000.”</p>

<h3>Maps in the Literature of Colonization</h3>
<p>The history of joining maps to literary efforts intent on parsing the American experience as one grounded in movement begins as early as 1493 with the publication of the bestselling pamphlet, <em>De Insulis nuper inuentis</em> (1493) containing Christopher Columbus’s letter to his patrons, King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella, in which descriptions of his experience were supplemented with <a href="/maps-movement-lit/1494-christopher-columbus#top">map-like woodcuts</a>. Within a decade, printers were quick to associate maps with travel reports, for example, with the dual publication of Martin Waldseemüller’s giant wall map, <em>Universalis Cosmographia Secundum Ptholomaei Traditionem et Americi</em> (1507) and Fracanzano da Montalboddo’s volume, <em>Paesi novamente retrovati</em> (1507). The Waldseemüller map is today celebrated for inventing “America” because it was the first map to name the continent (O’Gorman 1961; Schwartz 2007). Montalboddo’s anthology, on the other hand, is credited for publishing the first collection of reports detailing journeys to the American continent by, for example, Columbus, Amerigo Vespucci, and Gaspar Corte-Real. Within a short period of time, the genre of the travel report not only took Europe by storm, but, following the addition of woodcut illustrations by enterprising publishers, became associated with maps and the literary trope of mapped information, settings, and news events.</p>
<p>The topics of early modern travel reports revolved around questions of how to make contact with America, including tales of reconnaissance, the presence of saleable natural resources and commodities, the discovery of unfamiliar fauna and flora, and recommendations on how to launch “plantations” or how to negotiate the presence of Native Americans, then called “savages.” The language of the early reports shifted back and forth between personal diary and encyclopedic histories. Authors frequently struggled for words that were capable of reporting unfamiliar plants and objects, thus revealing formal and conceptual uncertainties about how to describe the experience of what literary historians have dubbed the “marvels” or “wonder” of the New World (Greenblatt 1992; Campbell 1999; Bauer 2003). By contrast, the image of maps—even if they were rudimentary, highly inaccurate, and frequently imaginary—offered a supposedly more stable and correct view for readers interested in tracking travel routes and picturing the geography and biodiversity of the new world.</p>
<p>Illustrated travel reports that included maps and map-like illustrations—from Georg Stuchs’s <em>Newe vnbekanthe Landte vnd ein newe Weldte</em> (1513) and Hans Staden’s <em>Warhaftige Historia und beschreibung eyner Landtschafft der Wilden Nacketen, Grimmigen Menschfresser-Leuthen in der Newenwelt America gelegen</em> (1557) to the bestselling editions of Theodor de Bry’s anthology, <em>Newe Welt vnd americanische Historien</em> (c.1650)—which included Thomas Hariot’s now canonical work <em>A Briefe and True Report of Virginia</em> (1590)—shaped the public imagination in two ways. On one hand, they introduced the myths of American cannibalism, the ubiquity of precious metals, and geographical fantasies of gaining access to the garden of Eden. On the other hand, they established the tradition that writing and reading about journeys to and inside America required maps as much for the purpose of navigation as for navigating the text itself. For example, the maps appending Captain John Smith’s <a href="/european-maps-for-exploration/1612-virginia#top"><em>Generall</em> <em>Historie of Virginia</em></a> (1624) and John Lederer’s <a href="/moving-pictures/1672-virginia#top"><em>Discoveries</em></a> (1672) contained dotted lines or large inky crosses, offering readers graphic signposts that corresponded with the volumes’ table of contents, allowing readers to retrace travel routes and encounters with indigenous populations in the Chesapeake Bay area and Carolina territory using the two textual landscapes of the map and the printed word.</p>
<p>Smith’s <a href="/maps-movement-lit/1616-new-england#top"><em>Map of New England</em></a> (1612) presented a somewhat different narrative model. Supplementing the fiercely self-promotional narrative titled <em>Description of New England</em> (1612), the map represents a palimpsest mixing authorial and literary ambitions. In the narrative, Smith assigns himself controversial powers demanding, under the guise of offering practical advice on how to colonize (“plant”) New England properly, the kind of trust and authority that is usually reserved for sovereigns and aristocratic government agents. In the map, he takes this sense of authority one step further: he not only rebaptizes native places with English names, such as “New London,” “The River Charles,” or “Oxford,” but inserts the author’s portrait in the margins; accompanied by a laudatory poem, Smith’s self-image appears in the symbolic space that mapmakers usually reserved for heraldry or other tokens of homage celebrating royalty or high-ranking sponsors supportive of risky Atlantic expeditions.</p>
<p>While in principle the genre of the travel report remains relatively unchanged during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the maps that accompanied them suggested a shift in compositional direction. The earliest reports were preoccupied with finding America; their contents concentrated on the American water/land divide, that is, on the relationship of the Atlantic Ocean with the American coast, coastal enclaves, corridors, and possible inroads into the continental hinterland (Benton 2010). At the same time, the reports experimented with linguistic and literary elements in the effort of rendering the unfamiliar in more familiar terms. While early travel accounts introduced to the English lexicon neologisms borrowed from European and Native American languages, on the whole (and perhaps unsurprisingly) they applied a Euro-centric approach to their literary craft: formal travel reports and informal diaries packed the American experience into established literary forms that were inflected by the literary protocols of historiography, the religious conversion narrative, and the encyclopedic method emerging from the natural sciences. Later accounts published during the mid seventeenth century, and thus after nearly two centuries of accumulating and mobilizing information, have travel writers locate their narratives inside a different hemispheric frame of reference, emphasizing (albeit with many overlaps) the Atlantic world and the American continent as one continual meta-setting.</p>
<p>The late seventeenth-century representation of the Atlantic world as a literary setting was the product of accounts that conceptualized the new world of America not in continental terms but as a watery world defined by the Atlantic Ocean, waterways, and islands. Many travel narratives, such as Richard Ligon’s <em>A True and Exact History of the Island of Barbados</em> (1657), resembled in narrative structure and content nautical maps like those compiled by William Hack’s <em>Waggoner Atlas</em> (1682) and William Blathwayt<em>’s Atlas</em> (1675-1685), which merged sea charts with detailed sailing directions in the effort to facilitate rapid movement in the Atlantic or Pacific oceans. Ligon’s history illustrates how the English-speaking world, driven by its growing focus on the Caribbean sugar and slave trade, conceived the experience of America as a succession of movements touching ground in unrelated settings between the coasts of Europe, Africa, and American islands. In particular Ligon’s spatial conception of the Caribbean strongly resembles the way in which early literary and political imaginings conceptualized America in un-continental terms.</p>

<p>Because the geological concept of continents was yet to be fully described and embraced, many travel writers and their readers, including members of the British Parliament, imagined America as an archipelago of loosely connected islands linked by bodies of water, tropical storms, and fantasies of geographic autonomy or nightmares of slave rebellion (Lewis and Wigen 1997). In the case of Ligon’s history, the author inserted the map <a href="/maps-movement-lit/1657-island-barbados#top"><em>A Topographicall Description… of Barbados</em></a> (1657) in which toponyms and pictorial elements anticipate descriptions about land ownership, farming techniques, and slave culture. The trope of moving the economically active individual to American islands in the Atlantic world was perhaps made most popular by Daniel Defoe’s proto-capitalistic novel, <em>Robinson Crusoe</em> (1719), and Jonathan Swift’s satire, <em>Gulliver’s Travels</em> (1726). Other works invested in geographic, economic, or spiritual mobility adapted the island theme, such as James Grainger’s Georgic poem, <em>The Sugar-Cane</em> (1764); Thomas Paine’s political pamphlet, <em>Common Sense</em> (1776); Olaudah Equiano’s autobiography, <em>The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano</em> (1789), describing his itinerant life as a slave during the 1750s and 1770s; and Hector St. Jean Creveceour’s <em>Letters from an American Farmer</em> (1782) in which rudimentary maps depicting the islands of Nantucket and Martha’s Vineyard provided visual plots for outlining the ideological concept of the “middle state” made popular in the now famous “Letter III: What is an American?”</p>
<p>The focus on Oceanic and Caribbean geographies began to wane as literature devoted to travels exploring the space of the continent increased rapidly during the eighteenth century. Fueled by the territorial conflicts between France and England, this literature included travelogues, natural histories, and geographies, which over the course of the decades expanded in geographic reach as well as literary application. While early tours like Sarah Kemble Knight’s <em>Diary</em> (1704) of a journey from Boston to Connecticut or Alexander Hamilton’s <em>Itinerarium</em> (1744) from Annapolis to Boston served to chart, albeit without the use of maps, the narrators’ movements between different local cultures, later works that included maps, such as Peter Kalm’s <em>Travels into North America… Enriched with a Map</em> (1773) and Jonathan Carver’s <em>Travels Through the Interior Parts of North America</em> <em>(1778), turned the localized observations into</em> international bestsellers.</p>
<p>The land-based continental perspective of movement emerged most fully in writings that were based on a handful of maps sponsored by government institutions. For example, John Mitchell’s <a href="/maps-movement-lit/1755-british-french#top"><em>Map of the British and French Dominions in North America</em></a> (1755) and his treatise <em>The</em> <em>Contest in America Between Great Britain and France</em> (1757) not only projected a continental extension for most British American colonies but provided language reflecting imperial ambitions pursued first by the British Empire and then later by American politicians negotiating the territorial claims of the newly formed United States of America. A similar impact can be attributed to Lewis Evans’s <em>A General Map of the Middle British Colonies</em> (1755), which was published along with his volume, <em>Geographical, Historical, Political, Philosophical and Mechanical Essays</em> (1755). Both the Evans map and his literary analysis of the mid-Atlantic region propagated the Enlightenment concept according to which North America is a pastoral setting capable of accommodating European immigrants despite Native American land claims and the increasing dependence on slave-based economies (Marx 1964; Franklin 1979; Hallock 2003).</p>
<p>It is in map accompaniments that readers will find sustained textual examples illustrating how maps informed literature of the colonial period and beyond. Combining literary conventions pioneered by European travel narratives—emphasizing the experience of the traveler/narrator, the careful tally of natural resources, and even the aesthetic appreciation of natural phenomena—both the eloquent and the laconic report borrowed amply from cartographic elements. Moving from simple inscription to complex imagery, travel reports incorporated and/or imitated place names and coordinates, wordy map inserts and allegorical cartouche imagery in order to better represent particular spaces, materials, and peoples. On occasion the authors’ preoccupation with maps had its pitfalls: For example, when European travelers lost their way because they had naively followed Native American maps, which, unlike Western cartography, marked places in spatio-temporal terms (Warhus 1997; Brückner 2006; Hollis 2011); or, when natural conditions, like shifting coastal sands, thwarted the authors’ desire for establishing literal and figurative boundaries as described in William Byrd’s <em>History of the Dividing Line</em> (1730; Franklin 1979); or, when the map as such was deemed to be a tool of representation superior to the English language as suggested by Thomas Jefferson’s first two chapters in his <em>Notes on the State of Virginia</em> (1784; Brückner 2006). In the examples where colonial authors purposefully prepared maps to accompany their writings, their verbal representation borrowed the map’s graphic mode of communicating authority by referencing map titles and geodetic accuracy, the cartographic lexicon and the supervisory “at a glance” method of visualization. Map-based information was presented selectively or generalized, allowing writers to name, edit, or omit contested places or unpleasant experiences. While references to maps, coordinates, and measurements transformed geographical descriptions into literary maps, the same rhetorical ploy frequently served to silence American voices, including Native Americans and European minorities, members of the working class and the enslaved.</p>

<h3>Maps in the Literature of Nation Formation</h3>
<p>After the Revolution, map-illustrated travel writing evolved into a popular genre, allowing several generations of authors to explore the new nation in small or large scale accounts as well as experiment with the formal parameters of the travel report (Kolodny 1984; Lewis 1988; Buell 1995). Sketch maps appended the regional journey documented by William Bartram’s <em>Travels through North and South Carolina, Georgia, East and West Florida, the Cherokee Country, etc.</em> (1791), which was quickly recognized for its elegiac tone and fantastical depiction of the American South. Similarly, Timothy Dwight’s more pondering <em>Travels in New England and New York</em> (1823), provided a new generation of writers with thick descriptions meshing geography, statistics, and local history. By contrast, much more detailed maps accompanied the reports of transcontinental expeditions, such as William Clark’s map supplementing Nicholas Biddle’s <em>History of the Expedition under the Command of Captains Lewis and Clark</em> (1814); or, Charles Preuss’s maps published in John Fremont’s polemical <em>Report of the Exploring Expedition to the Rocky Mountains in the Year 1842, and to Oregon and North California in the Years 1843-44</em> (1845) (Allen 1975; Baker 2006).</p>
<p>In these writings, even the most rudimentary map—like the one drawn by Bartram—emerged as a much-valued reading index for cross-referencing the journeys’ geographical progress with musings about the narrator’s psychological state, cultural geography, and the environment. Indeed, in the course of the nineteenth-century it could be argued that maps fostered literary strategies that turned prosaic descriptions of movement into poetic or philosophical masterpieces exploring questions unique to the American experience, in particular addressing questions about modern identity in the age of industrial mobilization as can be found in the mappings and meditations about life in Concord, Massachusetts, and the United States in Henry David Thoreau’s <em>Walden</em> (1854) or his essay “Walking” (1862).</p>
<p>While travel writers used word maps that sketched travel routes charting everything from small woods to the whole continent, the perhaps most popular form of experiencing the journey through the nation was made available to ordinary people by a burgeoning schoolbook industry that incorporated local and national maps into the geography lessons. Early slogans, like Noah Webster’s 1788 exhortation that “A tour of the United States ought now to be considered as a necessary part of a liberal education” (Webster 1965), spurred many authors and readers to consult geography books and their companion atlases as the next best alternative for traveling the country without having to leave the comfort and safety of the home or classroom. During the era of the early republic, Jedidiah Morse’ bestselling textbooks, such as <em>Geography Made Easy</em> (1784) shaped the geographical imagination of American writers as different as Susanna Rowson and Charles Brockden Brown by providing a model in literary mapping according to which fold-out maps—like Amos Doolittle’s <a href="/maps-movement-lit/1784-usa"><em>A Map of the United States of America</em></a> (1784)—supplemented the textbook’s encyclopedic framework intent on inventorying the geography, economy, and cultural customs of every state. One feature of Morse’s model and that of a host of other geographers was the textbook journey to geographical landmarks, such as the Niagara Falls in upstate New York, the Natural Bridge in Virginia, the Mammoth Cave in Kentucky, and so forth. At the same time, another feature of early national geography books was the literary construction of regionally inflected fictional character types, such as the thrifty New Englander or the lazy Virginia Gentleman. While biased and offensive even by contemporaneous standards, these place-based stereotypes informed geography lessons that required students to apply their textbook knowledge by touring the national map with eyes and fingers in search of the places and people that represented the “American character” (Brückner 2006).</p>
<p>At this point of the survey it is important to note that by the time the War of 1812 had ended the widespread inclusion of maps in genres like the travel report and the mass-produced textbook had come to define the horizon of literary expectation. At the same time, and this coincides roughly with Americans beginning to define literature as belletristic writing, the number of “literary” genres anthologized under the rubric of “American literature” rarely included a printed map. From the standpoint of the sociology and economics of literary production this may come as a surprise because historians of US print culture have demonstrated that in the course of the early nineteenth century maps were rapidly becoming inexpensive artifacts at the same time when publishers were increasingly willing to invest in book illustrations (Brückner 2017; Caspar 2007). From the standpoint of literary studies, moreover, the lack of actual maps illustrating movement is almost baffling in light of the frequency with which American authors of fiction used map references in their creative efforts to convey the American experience in thematic terms, for example, when exploring the vagaries of westward migration, class mobility, and the journeys of ex-slaves.</p>
<p>Although prose works, from the historical romance to the short story to the biographical sketch, lacked the material presence of maps, three types of fiction in particular displayed a strong affinity with popular map genres during the long nineteenth-century: picaresque narratives and small-scale overview maps; frontier stories and large-scale promotional maps; sensational fiction and river maps.</p>
<p>Especially during the first decades after Independence, American readers would have found that small scale maps, like the <a href="/maps-movement-lit/1784-usa">Doolittle map in <em>Morse’s School Geography</em></a>, not only showed the nation, the continent, and the transatlantic context, but also provided a convenient graphic device when following the plot of picaresque stories and novels. Like their European counterpart, the American picaresque chronicled the travels and travails of a single or a set of characters, usually of low social standing, whose movements ranged across the globe and tended to be episodic as well as highly unstructured because their progress was randomly subjected to irrational accidents, like storms and pirate attacks, rather than rational designs predicated on stationary planning (Davidson 1986).</p>
<p>In the anonymous novella, <em>The History of Constantius and Pulchera</em> (1795), the heroine or “picara” embarks on an improbable tour that takes the reader from Philadelphia to various settings along the North Atlantic rim (Essex, Mass.; Bourdeaux, France; Lisbon, Portugal; etc.) only to return in the end to the capital of the United States. Similarly, in James Butler’s <em>Fortune’s Football</em> (1798) the male protagonist, the “picaro,” occupies in quick succession geographic locales that included London, Venice, Malta, Algiers, London, Quebec, Florence, Isphahan, Bagdad, Moscow, and again London. While the characters’ rapid encounter of randomly placed settings was central to the story, picaresque stories like these required readers to consult small-scale maps—that is, maps showing large areas—in order to track the stories’ plots. Indeed, the haphazard movement of characters in novels, such as Royal Tyler’s <em>The Algerine Captive</em> (1797) or Charles Brockden Brown’s <em>Memoirs of Carwin, the Biloquist</em> (1803-05), loosely resembled the design of cartographic board games. Board games from Thomas Jefferys’s <em>Royal Geographical Pastime: Exhibiting a Complete Tour Round the World</em> (1770) to Milton Bradley’s <em>The Game of Round the World</em> (1873) mimicked the journeys of novelistic characters allowing readers to behave like players whose actions relied on chance rather than on personal intent or cultural reason (Brückner 2006).</p>
<p>A similarly calculated suspension of readerly order informed the mapping motifs in the kind of fiction that grappled with life on the western frontier. A good example is Caroline Kirkland’s fictionalized biography and novel of frontier manners, <em>A New Home—Who’ll Follow? or Glimpses of Western life?</em> (1839). It describes the experience of a middle-class East Coast family that, having been displaced by the economic crash of 1837, travels to southern Michigan following the paths laid out by large-scale promotional maps, that is, by maps showing a smaller area, like John Farmer’s <a href="/maps-movement-lit/1836-michigan-ouisconsin#top"><em>An Improved Map of the Surveyed Part of The Territories of Michigan</em> <em>and Ouisconsin</em></a> (1836). Farmer’s map and those designed by land speculators depicted a territory that was not only neatly subdivided according to the township system decreed by the US Land Ordinance Act of 1785, but that contained the core elements of modern infrastructure, including roads, towns, ferries, and so forth.</p>
<p>In the case of Kirkland’s narrative, however, after enduring detours, impassible roads, and nonexisting settlements, the characters (and readers) quickly discover that the map preceded the territory, that is, that the information on the map were fictional projections rather than factual representations of conditions on the ground. Or, as Kirkland writes, according to the “chart” advertising Michigan, there were “canals and railroads, with boats and cars at full speed. There was a steam-mill, a windmill or two; for even a land-shark did not dare to put a stream where there was scarce running water for the cattle; and a state road, which had at least been talked of, and a courthouse and other county buildings”—to which she added a quip against the way in which land speculators tricked prospective settlers: “Besides all this, there was a large and elegantly-decorated space for the name of the happy purchaser” (Kirkland 135). Similar tales commenting on the way in which maps had bewitched some characters while others bemoaned the blind trust in the authority of maps can be found in the sea novels by Herman Melville (<em>Mardi</em> 1849; <em>Moby Dick</em> 1851), in gothic tales by Edgar Allan Poe (<em>The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym</em> [1837] or “The Gold Bug” [1843]), and in Charles Dickens’s American novel, <em>The Life and Adventures of Martin Chuzzlewit</em> (1843-44) which includes a testy account of how promotional maps made false promises and lured unsuspecting emigrants to the American frontier.</p>
<p>Maps showing the course of the Mississippi River left perhaps the most profound mark on prose works during the long nineteenth century. A veritable “Who’s Who” of authors used the river as setting in a variety of genres in order to imaginatively illustrate geographic, economic, and social mobility. American readers would have found the river map reflected in the narrative plots of travel accounts from Frances Milton Trollope’s <em>The Life and Adventures of Jonathan Jefferson Whitlaw; or Scenes on the Mississippi</em> (1836), to Mark Twain’s <em>Life on the Mississippi</em> (1883) to George Byron Merrick’s <em>Old Times on the Upper Mississippi: the Recollections of a Steamboat Pilot from 1854 to 1863</em> (1909); in novels such as Mayne Reid’s <em>The Quadroon; or, A Lover’s Adventures in Louisiana</em> (1856), Herman Melville’s <em>The Confidence-Man: His Masquerade</em> (1857), and George Washington Cable’s <em>Gideon’s Band; a Tale of the Mississippi</em> (1914); and in young adult sensational tales from Friedrich Gerstäcker’s <em>The River Pirates of the</em> <em>Mississippi</em> (c.1848, 1900) and Edward Stratemeyer’s <em>The Rover Boys in Southern Waters; or, The Deserted Steam Yacht</em> (1907).</p>
<p>Two classic American novels in particular are closely associated with literary cartography, linking the delineation of movement to the readerly habit of tracing stories with map in hand: Harriet Beecher Stowe’s <em>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</em> (1852) and Mark Twain’s <em>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</em> (1885). In the case of Stowe’s abolitionist novel, river maps—like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201022033836/http://dcc.newberry.org/items/normans-chart-of-the-lower-mississippi-river" rel="nofollow"><em>Norman’s Chart of the Lower Mississippi River</em></a> (1858)—were at the heart of one of the novel’s more poignant scenes of literary mapping. Sitting on the moving deck of a riverboat, Tom surveys the southern plantation landscape in the terms of the mapmaker, in the process revealing as much as hiding the conditions on land, here how the image of neatly surveyed plantations disguised the fact that its picturesque looks were founded upon the brutal regime of slavery (<em>Uncle Tom’s</em> Cabin, Ch. 14). Throughout, the novel’s plot presupposes a carto-literate audience that is capable of following the fate of the principal characters, as they travel southwards on the river from state to state into the heart of American slavery and northwards along treacherous roads towards the Canadian border and freedom. While Stowe only implies the river map, she offers a more concrete map source in an episode reminiscent of the textbook travel lessons discussed above: the New England character of Miss Ophelia (and thus Stowe’s implied readership) studies the course of the river using “Morse’s Atlas” (<em>Uncle Tom’s</em> Cabin, Ch. 15), thus linking the novel’s plot either to Jedidiah Morse’s <em>Modern Atlas Adapted to Morse’s New School Geography</em> (1822) or to <em>Morse’s North American Atlas</em> (1845) published by his son Sidney E. Morse.</p>
<p>River maps loomed even larger in Twain’s famous tale about childhood and rebellion, Reconstruction America and the culture of racism. What is well-known today is that as a former river pilot Twain used his intimate knowledge of the Mississippi River when creating verbal depictions of its meandering course, overgrown banks, and islands, thus adding descriptive authenticity to the otherwise fictional construction of the characters’ vernacular speech and actions. What is perhaps less known is the fact that Twain was childhood friends with river pilots who not only helped create actual river maps, here <a href="/maps-movement-lit/1862-mississippi#top"><em>Lloyd’s Map of the Lower Mississippi River from St. Louis to the Gulf of Mexico</em></a> (1862), but also served as models for fictional characters like Tom Sawyer (Holland 2008).</p>
<p>More generally speaking, the river map left its generic mark on the way in which both Stowe and Twain structured their narratives. River maps tended to be constructed like “strip” or “ribbon” maps, and thus would consist of narrow paper segments showing only the land located on the left and right of the river. At the same time, they were often assembled as scrolls that were housed in wooden boxes with a display window, allowing pilots (and also travelers) to manually turn the ribbon map to match the boat’s position on the river. The narrative structures of the two novels behave similarly to these pilot maps: characters rarely stray from the river’s course; the omniscient narrators describe the hinterland extending beyond the river in mostly superficial terms when compared to the interactions with the river and its banks; and the rapid movement of the novel’s scenes, which critics today tend to consider as forerunners of a modern “filmic” technique and sensibility, resemble the mechanical motion of scrolling through pilot or ribbon maps.</p>

<h3>Maps in the Literature of two Gilded Ages, 1900/2000</h3>
<p>Map inserts representing movement—or for that matter places—remain mostly absent in the canon of American fiction during the long twentieth century, despite the fact that many authors creatively examined the mobilization of people in relation to modern transportation technology and emerging travel opportunities provided by trains, cruise ships, bicycles, motorcycles, and of course, the automobile. Bibliographic research probing paratextual metadata reveals only a smattering of printed maps supplementing novels, poems, and plays. When maps are present, they tend to be added to anniversary editions or lesson plans teaching classic works such as Melville’s <em>Moby Dick</em> or F. Scott Fitzgerald’s <em>The Great Gatsby</em> (Hopkins and Buscher 1999).</p>
<p>Yet, cartographic imaginings continued to abound in American prose fiction, in particular in novels that were inspired by the rise of the modern city and suburban developments, technological change and transnational awareness. In particular authors specializing in the genres of “low-brow” fiction, like the penny press Western or detective fiction, emulated the graphic code of cartographic representation in order to give depth and structure to imaginary landscapes, characters, and actions. For example, Owen Wister’s <em>The Virginian</em> (1902) and Zane Grey’s <em>Riders of the Purple</em> Sage (1912) applied the representational language of maps in order to better delineate places, in particular when creating the illusion of utopian, island-like settings located in the unruly territories of the western continent. Conversely, modernist mappings by authors like John Dos Passos playfully enlist the reading experience of urban street maps. In the case of Faulkner’s conception of “Yoknapatawpha County” a unique insert map appending <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> offers graphic guidance to multiple plot strands and points of view, in short a cartographic blueprint for tracking a multitude of objects, emotions, and voices.</p>
<p>Through the invocation of the visual experience and concept of the map twentieth-century literary mappings open up fictive worlds that are multidimensional, and whose spatiality is contingent upon a dialectic that pits geographies against ante-geographies according to which imaginary places exist not only outside known spaces but appear similar to or contiguous with the physical geography of the here and now (Padrón 2007; Turchi 2007, Pavlik 2010). Indeed, if we consider American literature as the discourse network “1900/2000” (to borrow from Friedrich Kittler’s study <em>Discourse Networks, 1800/1900</em>), thus bracketing modern American literary history, we will discover three literary genres devoted explicitly to literary cartographies in which maps are joined to literary journeys: The grand tour account; journeys to fictional worlds; and the American road trip.</p>
<p>The theme of the mapped “grand tour” entered American fiction during the Antebellum decades in the form of fictional or personal travel accounts describing visits to South America, the European continent, and the Holy Land for both children and adults. In both forms, rudimentary map inserts served the dual didactic purpose of teaching historical and national geography while providing blueprints for tracing the movement of fictionalized guides in works such as Samuel G. Goodrich’s <em>Peter Parley’s History of the Wanderings of Tom Starboard</em> (1834) or John L. Stephens’s <em>Incidents of Travel in Egypt, Arabia Petraea, and the Holy Land</em> (1837). After the Civil War, a burgeoning market for young adult fiction transformed the grand tour into gender specific genres. Offering geographical authentication and readerly guidance, map inserts were thus commonly found in Elizabeth W. Champney’s “Vassar girls” adventures (see her <em>Three Vassar girls in South America</em>: <em>a holiday trip of three college girls…</em> [1885]) and in Hezekiah Butterworth’s multi-book “Zigzag” series for boys. For example, in Butterworth’s <a href="/maps-movement-lit/1884-zigzag#top"><em>Zi__gzag Journeys in the Western States of America; the Atlantic to the Pacific</em></a> (1884) a foldout map was used to illustrate the size of the United States by fitting Europe into the space between California and the Mississippi River, while the volume’s endpapers contained map fragments to illustrate diverse travel routes next to images showing various modes of transportation. Each of these fictional travel accounts, wittingly or not, commented on the travelers’ shifting perception of time and space, the impact of speed, or the experience of rapid relocation using novel forms of transportation. Inspired by Jules Verne’s novel, <em>Around the World in Eighty Days</em> (1873), the American journalist, Nellie Bly, made headlines by embarking on the ultimate “grand tour”—later described with a map accompaniment in <em>Nellie Bly’s Book: Around the World in 72 Days</em> (1890)—that would have her race around the globe in order to break the Verne’s imaginary travel record, with newspaper audiences tracking her progress via maps and telegraphed reports (Wong 2007).</p>
<p>Changes in society and technology resonated strongly in the first American works of science fiction and later in the burgeoning genre of fantasy novels. Today, readers are perhaps most familiar with maps emphasizing stationary geographies, sweeping vistas of countries, continents, or parallel worlds invented in works ranging from extraterrestrial canals and waterways in Edgar Rice Burrough’s <em>A Princess on Mars</em> (1912) to the landscapes of Middle Earth in J. R. R. Tolkien’s trilogy, <em>Lord of the Rings</em> (1937-1949), from Frank Baum’s <em>Wizard of Oz</em> (1900) to Christopher Paolini’s <em>Eragon</em> (2003). Less familiar are the fictional maps showing imaginary journeys to unknown continents, the moon, and the deep sea that emerged parallel to scientific reconnaissance missions into the heart of Africa and Asia, innovations in engineering, and military experiments involving steam ships, submarines, balloons, and railroads.</p>
<p>Popular novels by Jules Verne and his imitators capitalized on what must have been a seemingly insatiable appetite for stories that mixed sensational plots and scientific theories. The story that caught the attention of American readers for nearly a century revolved around the “Hollow Earth” theory. In 1818, and thus long before the publication of Verne’s <em>Journey to the Center of the Earth</em> (1864), the American officer, Captain John Cleves Symmes, introduced the theory of a hollow earth containing concentric spheres that were accessible via large openings (1400 miles across) at both poles. Symmes’s theory inspired the anonymous science fiction novel, <em>Symzonia; Voyage of Discovery</em> (1820), in which the narrator, after gaining access to the inner surface of the earth at the South Pole, discovered a utopian society living deep inside the earth. The hollow earth fantasy of finding a parallel universe containing advanced albeit subterranean civilizations quickly became a staple of American popular fiction. Besides influencing Poe’s <em>The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym</em> (1838) and purportedly also Melville’s <em>Moby Dick</em> (1851), the hollow earth story had its perhaps greatest following in John Uri Lloyd’s fantasy novel <em>Etidorhpa, or, The End of Earth</em> (1895) in which the narrator, upon receiving instructions from an underground inhabitant, enters with map in hand the earth’s interior continents through a cave in Kentucky. American authors embraced Symmes’s theory far into the twentieth century, but none offered as explicit a map as did William Reed’s illustrated study of polar expeditions, <em>The Phantom of the Poles</em> (1906) showing the “<a href="/maps-movement-lit/1906-hollow-earth#top">Hollow Earth</a>”).</p>
<p>The final prominent genre containing the occasional map insert consists of “road” fiction and biographies that involved traveling long distances across the United States by car and more recently also by motorcycle, bicycle, and even on foot. Since the advent of the mass-produced car, the American media, and in particular car advertisements, has coined the “road trip” as a fantasy of unfettered geographical and social mobility. Fiction writers, many of whom were working freelance for movie and advertising companies, developed the theme of road travel into a productive metaphor, plot device, agent of action, even character—think Ian Fleming’s <em>Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang: The Magical Car</em> (1964) or Stephen King’s horror novel <em>Christine</em> (1983)—in order to convey life in a fast-paced America that was always on the move.</p>
<p>Classic modern narratives—from F. Scott Fitzgerald’s <em>The Great Gatsby</em> (1924) and John Steinbeck’ <em>Grapes of Wrath</em> (1938) to Jack Kerouac’s <em>On the Road</em> (1957) and Toni Morrison’s <em>Song of Solomon</em> (1977)—created elaborate literary maps exploring the exigencies of movement in modern American society. But while these novels omitted physical maps, autobiographical writings by John Steinbeck and William Least Heat-Moon purposefully included maps as part of the literary experience. The endpapers of Steinbeck’s travelogue, <em>Travels with Charley</em> (1962), depicted a road trip along the perimeter of the United States with the goal to find some answer to the question “What are Americans like today?” Heat-Moon’s <em>Blue Highways</em> (1982), whose title is named after the <a href="/maps-movement-lit/1955-road-map-southwestern#top">cartographic convention of drawing secondary roads in the color blue</a>, allows readers to follow with map in hand the author’s adventures and soul-searching meditations compiled during a 13,000-mile journey across America and through mostly forgotten small towns.</p>
<hr>
<p>When searching American literature for the presence of physical maps and the rhetoric of mapping in relation to the theme of movement and spatial representation, readers of critical studies will quickly discover an impasse formulated best by Henri Lefebvre’s somewhat cautionary assertion “that any search for space in literary texts will find it everywhere and in every guise” (Lefebvre 1991, 15). But when he asks the question “how many maps, in the descriptive or geographical sense, might be needed to deal exhaustively with a given space, to code and decode all its meanings and contents?” (85), the answer for readers of American literature despite the scarcity of the physical artifact would have to be “many.” Inspired by spatial theories like Lefebvre’s recent approaches to American literature tend to be informed by critical methodologies whose discussion of maps and mapping has provided new perspective and energy to literary criticism more generally (Brückner 2016).</p>
<p>Studies invested in “literary cartography” frequently invoke the terms and protocols developed by, for example, Michel de Certeau (maps are “a memorandum prescribing actions”; de Certeau 1984, 120), Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari (“the map does not reproduce an unconscious closed in upon itself; it constructs the unconscious”; Deleuze 1987, 12), or Jean Baudrillard (“the map precedes the territory”; Baudrillard 1994, 1). As the discourse of maps has come to pervade discussions of literary form and the tools of literary analysis, it is only a short leap to align older residual discussions of the factor of movement with the new critical terms of a modern mapping function, reconciling the classical rhetorical “topos” with the early modern neologism of “plot,” the early modern quest or pilgrimage motif with poststructural uses of “narrative,” and modern spatial idioms linking “travel” and “exploring” to “colonization” and “decolonization.” Indeed, it was the representational power of maps that has by now encouraged literary scholars to speculate how maps mobilized American literary culture figuratively and literally. If we consider Benedict Anderson’s critique of nationalism in relation to the history of print culture and Edward Said’s exploration of culture and imperialism, not to mention more recent discussions of transnational literature and identity, the discourse of maps and the language of mobility provide a fertile contact zone for addressing movement in a wide range of American literatures across time and space (Anderson 1991; Said 1993).</p>
<p>New editions of <em>The Norton Anthology of American Literature</em> or <em>The</em> <em>Heath Anthology of American Literature</em> still include maps in the endpapers (“North America to 1700” in front and “The United States: A Literary View” in the back). These maps track the movement of texts, characters, and readers in their historical moment spaces, thus suggestively making the representation of the map advance as the graphic container of literary history (Baym 1989; Lauter 2006; Alberti 2006). Indeed, if we accept Franco Moretti’s approach to the European novel, the conceptual tools of literary cartography emerge as a productive critical tool because only by mapping the text (and Moretti really wants us to use graphic maps) will we “bring … to light relations that would otherwise remain hidden” (Moretti 2005, 3). With the aid of the computational powers of “literary GIS” applications, new methodological models are now able to recover lost or overlooked map-based movements in American literature. Through digitization, both the map insert and the ubiquitous word map can easily be transformed into metadata that will allow the next generation of students to bridge the gap that has historically separated textual and cartographic representations of spaces in order to reclaim and better understand the meaning of movement in American literature.</p>

<h3>Further Reading</h3>
<p>Mapping movement has been a staple method for modern critics and popular readers intent on interpreting American literatures at least since Frederick Jackson Turner presented his “frontier thesis” in 1893 and D. H. Lawrence published his critical appreciation <em>Studies in Classic American Literature</em> in 1923. However, when approaching prose genres in which mobility is a central theme—and these genres range from contact narratives and travel reports to picaresque novels and its unique off-shoot, the “road” novel—critical studies have only recently begun to address how the literary representation of mobility related to actual printed maps and how the latter inflected works of prose fiction during the various stages of literary production and consumption.</p>
<p>There is no dearth in studies engaging with the factor of spatial mobility (as opposed to social mobility). Beginning with studies addressing eighteenth-century American literature, the motif of movement is central to works examining the figure of the traveler such as Perry Miller’s <em>Errand into the Wilderness</em> (1956), Percy G. Adams’ <em>Travel Literature and the Evolution of the Novel</em> (1983), and Barbara Stafford’s <em>Voyage into Substance: Art, Science, Nature, and the Illustrated Travel Account, 1760-1840</em> (1984). A great number of studies address spatial mobility in American fiction when examining the literary function of natural settings, like oceans, lakes, and rivers, or the technological means of transportation, including horse and boat journeys, railway, bicycle, and automobile travels. While these studies are too numerous to cite at length, readers will find the following works to offer a representative sample: Henry Nash Smith, <em>Virgin Land: The American West as Symbol and Myth</em> (1957), Richard Slotkin, <em>Regeneration Through Violence. The Mythology of the American Frontier</em> (1973), John D. Seelye, <em>Prophetic Waters: The River in Early American Life and Literature</em> (1977); or, Wolfgang Schivelbusch, <em>The Railway Journey: The Industrialization of Time and Space in the 19th Century</em> (1987), Kris Lackey, <em>RoadFrames: The American Highway Narrative</em> (1999), and Ann Brigham, <em>American Road Narratives.</em> <em>Reimagining Mobility in Literature and Film</em> (2015).</p>
<p>Nonfiction writings that have shaped the early canon of American literature, from Sarah Kemble to William Byrd, Olaudah Equiano to Sojourner Truth, Thomas Jefferson to Henry David Thoreau, contain the factor of geographic mobility according to a broad spectrum of critical works: Leo Marx’s cultural study of literary form, <em>The Machine in the Garden</em> (1964); Wayne Franklin’s recovery project <em>Discoverers, Explorers, Settlers. The Diligent Writers of Early America</em> (1979); Annette Kolodny’s feminist study, <em>The Land Before Her: Fantasy and Experience of the American Frontiers, 1630-1860</em> (1984); Lawrence Buell’s ecocritical study, <em>The Environmental Imagination</em>: <em>Thoreau Nature Writing, and the Formation of American Culture</em> (1995); and Bruce Harvey’s transnational approach, <em>American Geographics. U. S. National Narratives and the Representation of the Non-European World, 1830-1865</em> (2001).</p>
<p>Work engaging directly with the relationship of maps and literature taps a diverse field of investigation exploring the construction of fictional worlds more generally and the conventions of children’s literature or fantasy tales in specific: see for example, Ricardo Padrón’s “Mapping Imaginary Worlds,” (in <em>Maps: Finding Our Place in the World</em>, 2007); Peter Turchi, <em>Maps of the Imagination. The Writer as Cartographer</em> (2007); Anthony Pavlik, “‘A Special Kind of Reading Game’: Maps in Children’s Literature,” <em>International Research in Children’s Literature</em> (2010); and J. B. Post, <em>An Atlas of Fantasy</em> (1979).</p>
<p>For studies examining the relationship of maps and American literature from angles that include literacy and education, sign theory and abolitionism see Martin Brückner, <em>The Geographic Revolution in Early America: Maps, Literacy, and National Identity</em> (2006), Anne Baker, <em>Heartless Immensity. Literature, Culture, and Geography in Antebellum America</em> (2006), William Boelhower, “Inventing America: A Model of Cartographic Semiosis,” (in <em>Word &amp; Image</em> 1988), and Martha Schoolman, <em>Abolitionist Geographies</em> (2014). Only a few studies explicitly examine the relationship between maps and movement in American literature: see the early essay by Phillip C. Muehrcke and Juliana O. Muehrcke, “Maps in Literature” (in <em>Geographical Review</em> 1974), the edited volume by Martin Brückner and Hsuan Hsu, <em>American Literary Geographies</em> (2007), and the essays by Martin Brückner “The Ambulatory Map: Commodity, Mobility, and Visualcy in Eighteenth-Century Colonial America” (in <em>Winterthur Portfolio</em> 2011), and Gavin Hollis, “The Wrong Side of the Map? The Cartographic Encounters of John Lederer” (in <em>Early American Cartographies</em> 2011).</p>

  return `<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The very essence of coast-wise and maritime navigation is evoked in the <a href="/navigating-the-coasts-and-seas/1820-ships-and-navigation#top">engraved plate of a volcano with an oared boat and sailing ships</a> from the 1820 edition of Abraham Rees’s <em>Cyclopaedia</em> in the holdings of the Newberry Library. It was based on an original sketch from life in 1797, but it possesses an air of timelessness; people in boats and ships, powered by oars and the wind, passing Mount Vesuvius busily going somewhere along a coast of a great sea. Yet, as a modern library, the Newberry collections span only the last 900 to 1,000 years, as they consist of written words and maps and books and sketches on parchment, vellum, paper, or the like. The world they present is not timeless at all.</p>
<p>Before 1,000 years ago, all the oceans and seas of the planet had been explored, except the great Southern Ocean surrounding the continent of Antarctica. The shores and many of the islands of the Arctic Ocean had been explored and inhabited by peoples using magnificently creative technologies to survive in such a challenging environment. People had explored the vast reaches of the Pacific Ocean and had populated isolated rocks and whole archipelagoes of islands. Migration and trade routes along continental coasts, and between continents, had transformed cultures and linked peoples across vast distances into networks of trade, and war, and empire. How could people have done this, before “maps” in the forms we currently know them, had existed?</p>
<p>A very long time ago humans everywhere mastered the wandering cosmography of the Sun and Moon and planets against the fixed stars, as they experienced them. They noticed the patterns of seasonal weather; they knew the systems of tides, even if they didn’t necessarily understand them. They saw patterns of migration in the movement of animals, fish, and birds, and derived much from those patterns. They recognized ocean currents and consistent wind patterns, and gave them names. In general they talked about all these matters and remembered the talk, so that generations and millennia of human explorations were condensed into layered narratives and accumulated geographies.</p>
<p>Around 800 CE, Irish monks and Viking warrior-farmers established settlements on Iceland, which until that moment had been the largest uninhabited land mass on the planet, apart from Antarctica. It is unclear exactly how they navigated to and from Iceland, but they recorded the stories of their migration in written chronicles, with words in ink on parchment. From about that moment, the era of modern libraries like the Newberry could begin. Shortly thereafter came the era so often labeled the Age of Exploration, although what that really meant was the Age of Western European Exploration and Empire. We are quite familiar now with the narratives, and their counter-narratives. We are less familiar with the nascent almanacs and ephemerides, the manuals the positions of specific celestial bodies calculated in advance, like the fifteenth century Portuguese Regiment of the Sun, which allowed mariners possessing the manuals and requisite instruments on their ships to calculate their latitudes daily with remarkable precision, for the era.</p>
<p>And an even more interesting set of stories unfolds when we advance to the cusp between the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the times of Edmond Halley and Isaac Newton, when the techniques of nascent modern science were applied to the ancient arts and skills of navigation. This essay is an illustrated introduction to these stories, including a small set of the myriad actors and institutions that addressed earthly position and navigation between positions systematically. Along the way they invented whole classes of instruments and associated tables and techniques, and they standardized time, the implications of which have transformed both human society and human perceptions of the cosmos. Hence, we begin this essay on marine navigation not with a nautical chart, but rather a chart which would forever structure all subsequent nautical charts and mappings of every kind.</p>

<h3>The Many Returns of Edmond Halley</h3>
<p>Edmond Halley (1656-1742) for whom Halley’s Comet was named, was a giant in the history of scientific observation, and also the <a href="/navigating-the-coasts-and-seas/1732-variations-of-the-compass#top">visualization of conclusions derived from such observations</a>. Notice, to begin, that what we call the Atlantic Ocean Halley divided into two basins, western and southern. The western basin, also called the North Atlantic, had been traversed for many centuries at that point, and the use of magnetic compasses had become ubiquitous. It had been apparent since their beginnings that compasses did not generally point accurately toward true north, and the patterns of variation also became gradually known. It was Christopher Columbus, in his first voyage, who first observed the change in magnetic variation switch from west to east of true north. The southern ocean, or South Atlantic, was known primarily only along the edge of Africa and along specific cross-ocean trade routes related to the great commerce in human slaves between western Africa and the New World. In 1698, and 1699-1700, Halley commanded the Royal Navy ship Paramour in explorations of the southern ocean, in what was the very first British scientific voyage. The patterning of compass magnetic variations (variations east and west from true north) that Halley discovered, he presented in 1701 in his first, and the very first, use of isogonic lines in Western cartography. “Isogonic” lines link areas in which a certain value is the same. Contours of elevation on a hiking map, or contours of depths of the ocean bottom offshore from a beach are similar to Halley’s isogonic lines of equal degrees of magnetic deviation east and west from true north. This particular chart of magnetic variation is from the revised second edition of Halley’s chart, published in 1732. The earth’s magnetic field changes very slowly and steadily, a process called “secular variation,” and the variation had changed enough by decades later that Halley updated his chart.</p>
<p>Halley’s revised magnetic variation chart was published in the 1732 edition of <em>The English Pilot</em>, which was begun by John Seller, Sr. (1630-1697) in 1675. Seller, as a bookseller and printer, atlas compiler, and Hydrographer to the King, was a giant in the establishment of printed aids to nautical navigation, beginning in 1669 with his treatise <em>Practical Navigation: or, An introduction to that whole art. Containing I. Several definitions in geometry, astronomy, geography, and navigation. 2. A new and exact kalender, etc.</em> <em>The English Pilot</em> in some form has been continuously in print to the present day. The 1732 edition contained, besides the revised magnetic variation chart, Halley’s ”<a href="/navigating-the-coasts-and-seas/1732-coast-pilot-chart#top">A Correct Map of the Coast of New England</a>.” The continental and island shore lines are shown in an equirectangular projection called the plate carré, which has significant distortions, but for relatively small areas, such as offshore from New England, the distortions are manageable. Some areas of the ocean display soundings, from the old French word “sonder,” meaning to measure. The numbers on the water referring to the water depth at that spot, derived from sounding the bottom with lead weights on ropes marked by increments of length. There is a compass rose in the approximate center of the ocean expanse. The compass rose is closely related to the wind rose; both are devices tracing back centuries, to assist in plotting ships’ courses relative to the 32-point “rose,” or divisions of the 360-degree circle. Shallow shoal areas, such as the Georges Bank east of Cape Cod, are marked and sounded, as these were extremely important fishing grounds, essential to commerce on both sides of the Atlantic. Boston, the most important harbor in eastern North America at the time, is shown in great detail in an inset map in the upper left corner. Notice as well what is not presented: any indication of Native American lands or waters, nor any French land or sea claims.</p>
<p>Much transpired between the last chart and the next one, principally a series of wars between France and Great Britain, with and against Native Americans as well, in complexly changing alliances, and the American Revolution, and the beginnings of the Industrial Revolution. Through it all, complex trade across the Atlantic involving raw materials, finished commodities, slaves, immigrants, and currencies, drove societies on all sides of the ocean basin.</p>

<h3>The American Progression</h3>
<p>In 1796, Edmund Blunt the Elder (1770-1862), who had been a bookseller in Newburyport, Massachusetts, became a book publisher, printing his first edition of <em>The American Coast Pilot</em>, which was modeled on (and partially stolen from) <em>The English Coast Pilot</em>, a publication related to <em>The English Pilot</em>, and basically addressing the divisions between coast-wise and maritime navigation discussed at the beginning of this essay. Blunt formed an alliance with a Captain Lawrence Furlong, about whom little is known, except for the obvious fact that Furlong was a master mariner, with detailed and accurate knowledge of the North American coast from Labrador to the Caribbean. Blunt’s work was extraordinarily successful, and new improved editions followed quickly. Sometime around 1800, Blunt began a partnership with Nathaniel Bowditch (1773-1838) who was a mathematical prodigy and master of navigational sciences born into an ancient seafaring family in Salem, Massachusetts. They schemed to create a new, improved edition of another British navigational authority, <em>The New Practical Navigator, being an Epitome of Navigation</em>, which had been written by John Hamilton Moore (1738-1807), who was a skilled British mathematician and innovator in navigational techniques. Furlong’s <em>American Coast Pilot</em> was primarily addressed to coast-wise navigation along the American coast, and the intricacies of sailing in and out of complex harbor channels, etc. Moore’s <em>Epitome of Navigation</em> was a general treatise on celestial navigation, determining latitude and longitude at sea by reference to astronomical positioning, and particularly to improved methods to determine a ship’s longitude, by use of tables of the projected positions of the Moon at specific future times and dates as experienced at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich. These were presented in <em>The Nautical Almanac and Astronomical Ephemeris</em>, established in 1767 by the Astronomer Royal Nevil Maskelyne (1732-1811). By knowing Greenwich Time at a specific instant, and knowing as well the local time at the same instant, the time difference between Greenwich and the local position could be translated easily into a difference in longitude between Greenwich and the local position. Unfortunately, the calculations involved in creating the tables were difficult, and subject to numerous errors, which then translated into errors in position. Nathaniel Bowditch was a mathematical savant, who could spot errors and do calculations in his head. Bowditch also figured out tables to simplify or eliminate many of the numerous corrections and adjustments which had to be made to the apparent lunar positioning in order to determine longitude accurately.</p>
<p>All this culminated in 1802, with Blunt’s publication of Bowditch’s <em>New American Practical Navigator</em>, which was recognized almost immediately as a major contribution to ocean navigation. Each succeeding edition of “the Bowditch” as it has become known, introduced new materials, especially maps and charts, such as this <a href="/navigating-the-coasts-and-seas/1807-trade-winds#top">1807 Chart of the Atlantic Ocean</a>. Like Halley’s chart from nearly a century earlier, the chart features a compass rose in the approximate center of the Western Ocean, or North Atlantic. The chart also has some arrows showing consistent ocean current direction, and a great arc, named as “The Trade Wind” which is more accurately described as the course of the Gulf Steam flowing from the south and then east towards the coast of northwestern Europe. The chart also shows the track of a ship’s voyage from Boston Harbor into and along the great arc, and then directly east to the Portuguese island of Madeira, southwest of the Iberian Peninsula. That journey was accompanied by a complete journal of the process of navigating from Boston to Madeira, written to illustrate most or all of the navigational techniques presented by Bowditch. In that era, there were copyright laws in force in both Great Britain and the United States, although they varied from our present legal conceptions of copyright a good deal. But in any case, a way of making the case that a new edition of somebody else’s book didn’t violate copyrights to the book was to make additions and improvements to it. The original British editions of Moore’s <em>New Practical Navigator</em> taught his navigational techniques through a journal of a voyage from London to the island of Tenerife, in the Canary Islands off the coast from the western Sahara in Africa. Bowditch’s version voyaged from Boston to Madeira, and hence was “new, and improved!”</p>
<p>The 1807 edition of “the Bowditch” also includes illustrations of the three major instruments of navigation as used in the western tradition in that era: (1) <a href="/navigating-the-coasts-and-seas/1807-trade-winds#top">The mariners compass</a>, with its 32-point divisions, known as the compass rose, here mounted on gimbals in a box, to compensate for the rocking movements of the ship; (2) <a href="/navigating-the-coasts-and-seas/1807-trade-winds#top">equipment to determine the speed of the ship</a>, consisting of an hourglass for timing, and a spool on which line can be wound, and a “log”, which when thrown overboard off the back end of the ship attached to the line, will tend to stay in the same place in the water, while ship moves forward and the line runs out, until the moment the hourglass empties. The length of the line unrolled during the time of the hourglass can then be converted into an estimate of the speed of the ship; and (3) <a href="/navigating-the-coasts-and-seas/1807-trade-winds#top">two versions of the general class of angle-measuring instruments called, generally, quadrants</a>. Isaac Newton (1642-1727) actually devised the concept for a celestial angle measuring device using double-reflecting mirrors, a description of which he gave to Edmond Halley. This was not published until after Halley’s death in 1742, by which time a British mathematician, John Hadley (1682-1744), and an American optician and inventor, Thomas Godfrey (1704-1749) had, about 1730, independently invented their own versions of the instrument. Well into the next century, the instruments were commonly known as Hadley’s quadrants. In the Bowditch image, the instrument on the left is described as a quadrant, although it is more properly an octant, as its curved arc represents an eighth, or forty-five degrees, of a circle. The instrument in the right is a sextant, with an arc of sixty degrees, or a sixth of a circle. With this general class of instrument, it is possible to measure the angle between two celestial objects reasonably accurately, by night, from the deck of a moving ship, which is an extraordinary achievement. This triad of instrument systems for determining the direction, speed, and position of a ship became universal in the western traditions of navigation until the twentieth century and the advent of radio systems and electronic instruments. Even now, in the absence of electronics, the triad still works well.</p>

<h3>The Era of Powered Craft</h3>
<p>The next major development in coast-wise and maritime navigation is actually one of the most important developments on this subject in human history: Ship propulsion by non-human power. Until about the 1780s, all coast-wise and maritime navigation involved boats and ships like those in Plate One, propelled by human labor, and/or wind and currents. With the invention of steam engines, originally designed for very terrestrial work in mines and quarries, it soon became clear that propulsion of boats and ships by engines would transform travel over water. After many failed or unsatisfactory attempts, inventors on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean developed successful <a href="/navigating-the-coasts-and-seas/1820-ships-and-navigation#top">steam-powered craft</a> in the 1780s. Steamboats began in coast-wise navigation, as the early ones weren’t capable of voyaging on the open ocean. Rapid improvements in all aspects of the ships’ design, as well as improvements in engines, soon changed this. The steamboat presented in Rees’s <em>Cyclopaedia</em> in 1819 was designed for use in relatively shallow and relatively calm water, as in a lake or on canals, or coastal waters, indicated by the flat keel and propulsion by paddle wheel, which limits contact with shallows, rocks and other underwater impediments to navigation. The craft appears to be a passenger-carrying vessel, with cabins with lots of windows and a fenced deck for sightseeing. Notice the hybrid nature of the vessel, combining the latest technology, a steam engine, with square sails for sailing with the wind, the very oldest type of sail. Below the boat are two different steam engine designs, both of which turn the energy released in steam into revolutions of a giant wheel, from which different applications can take off power for different purposes.</p>
<p>Steamships could travel when there was no wind, and could be driven directly into the wind, which had never before been possible. Further, without the need for sails, or at least needing fewer, steamships could travel more upright in the water, not heeling over as sailing ships must. The result of all these changes was that steamships quickly became the most important tool in producing maritime charts and other aids for all types of coast-wise and maritime vessels. The best conditions for hydrography are when the sea and winds are calm. Sailing vessels cannot function then, but steamships can travel and serve as platforms for work efficiently. Their very efficiency created much more detailed charts of coastal features, since steamships could “hug the coast” while traditional sailing ships stayed much further offshore from the coast to have a margin of safety. The American Pacific Coast was the first major section of coast surveyed and mapped expressly to accommodate steamships. At the same time, steamships require fuels and clean fresh water for steam, the search for which constrained ships’ crews and their schedules in ways never imagined before the transition to powered craft. But the change, once it began, became almost total. Today powered craft completely dominate world navigation, with human and wind-powered craft confined to small and especially recreational craft, and to the boats of the poor and marginal.</p>
<p>In essence, the published coast pilots were expert detailed verbal descriptions of specific places along the coast, and how to enter and exit them, and important issues and concerns while doing so. The new practical navigators were sets of tools and techniques, and useful charts and tables, to help navigators establish their positions accurately and precisely. The “modern” system of nautical charts, which actually began along the North Sea coasts in the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth centuries, was a fusion of the two approaches. The foundation for the charting was a rigorous geodetic network of triangulated stations along the coast, which served as the positional framework for mapping out on the water. Nearshore positions in a boat could be determined geometrically in relation to sets of signal flags and other markers. At the same time the crews of the boats were sighting the angles between themselves and sets of the flags, others could take lead-line soundings to establish the water depth at that spot. All of this data could then be checked and correlated, and charts prepared, with horizontal positioning from the signal flag work, and vertical water depths through the soundings, all controlled by the relative accuracy of the geodetic network “backbone.” The accurate horizontal positioning this made possible then aided the production of accurate visual profiles and coastal views of landforms and harbor entrances to assist and warn mariners.</p>
<p>In 1807, Ferdinand Hassler (1770-1843), a Swiss immigrant scientist, successfully persuaded President Thomas Jefferson to use this technique for the American Survey of the Coast, authorized by Congress. The Survey’s early history was rocky and contentious, but by about 1834 Hassler’s system was deployed in force. Once four years later, in 1838, the Coast Survey commissioned a commercial printer to produce the very first chart of the <a href="/navigating-the-coasts-and-seas/1838-us-coast-survey-chart-new-haven#top">Survey of the Coast, New Haven Harbor</a>. This harbor chart is very provisional compared to charts of a decade later, but Hassler’s methods are clearly displayed. Hassler pioneered working simultaneously on mapping the topography of the land, and the hydrography of the waters, tying them both together through the same sets of signal flags mounted along the shore. The spider webs of lines of number in the harbor are the lines of travel of the hydrographic boats, with the position of the numbers representing the horizontal positions of the boats, and the numbers themselves represent the depths of the water at precisely those spots. The marshes, woodlands, farmed fields, and houses on the land were positioned by the same triangulation process as used for the hydrography, and topography and hydrography ultimately controlled horizontally by the master geodetic network Hassler established. There were two systems for vertical heights and depths, both based on the tidal systems of the harbor. The legend reports “the greatest tide observed in two Lunations,” or two complete lunar months, which gives some indication of the length of their fieldwork at the harbor. Heights on the land were based on a level of mean high tide, so that everything above that level was “land”, at least most of the time. The hydrographic depths were based on the level of mean low tide, so that depths mapped were at least that deep, most of the time. With a few changes and improvements, Hassler’s methodologies displayed in the New Haven Harbor chart continued for most of the next century, until airplanes and aerial photography, and boats equipped with sonar depth finder changed nautical charting again.</p>
<p>On first glance, the <a href="/navigating-the-coasts-and-seas/1833-stage-and-steamboat-routes-ohio#top">Travelers Pocket Map of Ohio with its canals, roads and distances, by stage &amp; steam boat routes</a> (New York, 1833), may seem anomalous in an essay on coast-wise and maritime navigation, but it is closely related to what came before, and reflects the fresh transformations in travel by boat and ship underway. All steam engines required fuel for their boilers and clean water for steam. The engines were made primarily of iron and steel, and slowly more and more ships were “iron-bottomed” too. Close available stocks of firewood and iron ore and coal were rapidly depleted, leading to a relentless search for these resources ever farther away. The “inland seas” of the Great Lakes, in particular, offered ships access to vast stores of metal ores, coal, chemicals and salts necessary to the Industrial Revolution. But there were choke-points on the waterways, particularly rapids and waterfalls, like Niagara Falls. The solution was to build canals around obstructions, and canals to supply more direct access to sources of bulk commodities, and link them to river transport, and ever larger steam ships on the Great Lakes. All these systems ultimately were connected to the maritime shipping systems previously developed. Hence it made perfect commercial sense for Edmund Blunt the Elder, the publisher of the <em>American Coast Pilot</em> and the <em>New American Practical Navigator</em>, to publish a guide to roads and canals in Ohio, and the shipping routes of bordering Lake Erie, and to do so in the form of a small, convenient pocket-sized volume. Blunt also published <em>The Stranger’s Guide to the City of New-York</em> (London, 1818), a volume which still tantalizes and delights.</p>

<h3>The World Nearing Whole</h3>
<p>By the middle of the nineteenth century, Western ships and their crews were sailing and steaming in all oceans and almost all coasts, except for the shores of Antarctica. Popular and scientific interest in these voyages was high, and a number of geographical societies and important geographic journals were established. In 1851, the American Geographical and Statistical Society was founded in New York City (“statistical” was later dropped from its title). In 1854, August Petermann founded <em>Petermanns Geographische Mitteilungen</em>, a journal of geography and cartography, in Gotha, Thuringia, in what later was to be central Germany. Petermann and his craftsmen were experts in lithography and especially chromo-lithography, the art of lithographing in co-registered color. Their skills quickly made Petermanns the premier geographic journal on the planet. An examination of a single annual volume for the year 1859 yields <a href="/navigating-the-coasts-and-seas/1859-frontiers-of-ocean#top">three maps that convey the frontiers of maritime navigation in that year</a>, in multiple senses. The maps are stratified by the three bands of latitude they present: The tropics, the broad temperate zone, and the Arctic.</p>
<p>The tropical map presents a historic political and legal framework unfamiliar to most Americans: The <a href="/navigating-the-coasts-and-seas/1859-frontiers-of-ocean#top">great archipelago of islands constituting American Polynesia</a>. The context is this: by the 1840s, American supplies of phosphate rock, a relatively scarce yet critical chemical material used in gunpowder and for fertilizer, were running out. Bird guano, deposited over eons on exposed rocks and islands in the oceans, became a substitute for mined deposits of phosphate rock. Many of these rocks and islands were located in extremely remote places, which is in part why they were favorable sites for nesting birds. In 1856, Congress passed the Guano Islands Act, which stated: “Whenever any citizen of the United States discovers a deposit of guano on any island, rock, or key, not within the lawful jurisdiction of any other Government, and not occupied by the citizens of any other Government, and takes peaceable possession thereof, and occupies the same, such island, rock, or key may, at the discretion of the President, be considered as appertaining to the United States.” Only three years later, many dozens of such rocks and islands and keys in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean had been claimed as territories of the United States, and hence a broad curvy line encircles a portion of the vast archipelago of islands and reefs straddling the Equator. Note that this 1859 conception of American Polynesia did not include American Samoa, which is a portion of the Samoa cluster of islands in the center of the map directly south of the boundary of American Polynesia. American claims to Samoa came later, between 1887-1889, in a great crisis between the United States and the British and German Empires.</p>
<p>In 1859, the United States and Great Britain were involved in contention and disputes over territorial claims in the great band of temperate latitudes, on the Pacific coast at the boundary zone between Washington Territory in the United States, and the Colony of British Columbia in Canada, then still claimed by Great Britain as British territory. The terrestrial portion of the boundary between the nations was mutually agreed to be the 49th Parallel of latitude, but agreements dissolved at the Pacific water’s edge. Great Britain and the United States agreed that all of Vancouver Island was British, although it extended south of the 49th Parallel. But there are a myriad of islands in between Vancouver Island and the mainland of the continent; to whom would they belong? The Haro Archipelago, or San Juan Islands, was at stake. As the <a href="/navigating-the-coasts-and-seas/1859-frontiers-of-ocean#top">map in <em>Petermanns</em></a> clearly reveals, the rival national boundary claims are actually two major ship routes in between the Strait of Juan de Fuca on the south, and the Georgia Strait on the north. Hence, the national claims to territory on land were based on different pathways of ships in the water around the land. Eventually Great Britain acceded to the American claims, and the San Juan Islands are part of the state of Washington in the United States.</p>
<p>Moving now to the Arctic, we can examine a map and <a href="/navigating-the-coasts-and-seas/1859-frontiers-of-ocean#top">another inset map</a> defining one of the most celebrated tragedies of exploration in the nineteenth century. For centuries, European explorers had searched for a conjectured “Northwest Passage” which would lead from the western Atlantic Ocean further northwest to enter the Pacific Ocean, allowing travel by water at temperate latitudes, with minimal disruptions and hazards from ice. None of their explorations were successful, although in the effort they “discovered” major portions of what is now Canada, almost all of which had already been explored and settled by native Athabascan, Micmac, Algonquin, Iroquois, and Inuit and other peoples. Eventually, Sir John Barrow, who was Second Secretary of the British Admiralty from 1804 until 1845, proposed that Great Britain should search for a much more northerly Northwest Passage, which would link the more northern Atlantic Ocean to the Arctic Ocean, essentially going over the top of most of Canada, and then onto the Pacific Ocean through the Bering Strait. Eventually Barrow settled on Sir John Franklin to command the expedition to find the passage. He commanded the officers and men of two ships, HMS Terror and HMS Erebus, which had been built for duty exploring the fringes of Antarctica, and were well equipped for Arctic service. Each had a steam engine designed and built for British railroads, along with steam-heat for the crew, and ships’ libraries with more than a thousand books. They departed England in May, 1845. Apart from Franklin and the captain of the other ship, and an assistant surgeon and two ice-masters, none of the other 129 men had any experience at all in the Arctic. Off they steamed, and then they disappeared. After two years had passed, the British public, and also Mrs. Franklin, urged the Admiralty to send teams to search for the party and learn their fate. The search for the fate of Sir John Franklin became one of the cultural touchstones of the era. Many expeditions were launched, and over time, clues were found. The 1859 <em>Petermanns</em> map indicate the major findings as of that date, although the “search for Sir John Franklin” continued well into the twenty-first century, and is still in progress. The map on the left shows the known route of the expedition until it turned back south. The two dotted paths were the speculative routes necessary so that ships’ survivors could have arrived on the small islands in McClintock Sound where significant remains and clues were found. The map on the right, at a much larger scale, shows the final area and its context. It also demonstrates that waves of searchers managed to ignore native Inuit place names, if they even knew them in the first place, and instead they littered the landscape with their own names.</p>
<p>Less than three decades after Franklin steamed off to his dreadful fate, another Arctic expedition disappeared into the white void for two years, but returned as a triumphant success. The differences between the two expeditions include better luck and better provisions, but also the changes underway in the very purposes and goals of exploration by ship in extreme Arctic and Antarctic environments. In 1872, the <a href="/navigating-the-coasts-and-seas/1877-austro-hungarian#top">Austro-Hungarian North Pole Expedition</a>, which was privately funded by several wealthy noble families in Austria-Hungary, steamed into the Arctic Ocean in summer aboard a small fleet of ships, the main one of which was the Tegetthoff, a three-masted schooner with a powerful steam engine. The two leaders, Captain Karl Weyprecht and Julius von Payer, were skilled scientists, and the small crew included many specialists in meteorology, astronomy, geodesy, and terrestrial magnetism. The Tegetthoff sailed north, discovering the Franz Josef Archipelago of Arctic islands before the ship was caught in pack ice. For almost two years, the ship was stuck in the ice, although the pack ice moved, as they were able to measure by determining their positions astronomically. In May, 1874, the party determined to abandon the ice-locked ship and return south over the ice, with sledges carrying small boats to be used once they reached the margins of the ice pack. They actually accomplished this, and on August 14, 1874, they reached the open ocean. On September 3, they reached the Russian mainland, having sailed and rowed across more than a hundred miles of the open Arctic Ocean. They returned to Vienna, the capital of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, as heroes. Members of the expedition published many reports on various scientific observations from the voyage, and their productivity was a spur towards the creation of a great collaborative scientific project, the International Polar Year, in 1882-83. The voyage of the Tegetthoff was in many ways the beginnings of modern polar science.</p>
<p>A related application of maritime navigation to the earth sciences can be seen in <a href="/navigating-the-coasts-and-seas/1891-algae-concentrations#top">Otto Krümmel’s pioneering map of the Sargasso Sea</a>, at the center of the North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre, published in <em>Petermanns</em> in 1891. The Sargassum Sea is named for Sargassum, a genus of brown algae, and especially Sargassum bacciferum, which grows in abundance in the lens of warm water pushed in on top of permanently colder water below by the actions of the subtropical gyre which surrounds the Sea. A look back at Bowditch and Blunt’s 1807 chart showing <a href="/navigating-the-coasts-and-seas/1807-trade-winds#top">“The Trade Wind,”</a> compared to Krümmel’s map, shows the relationship between an arm of the gyre and the Sargasso Sea. The dense Sargassum drifts in the Sargasso Sea serve as nurseries for the larvae of both American and European eel species, and as protective habitat for young endangered loggerhead sea turtles, as well as many other sea creatures. On the map, the dark cross-hatched strands which are largely vertical or horizontal represent the mappings that the great German scientist Alexander von Humboldt made of what he called “Fucusbänke,” the long windrow-like concentrations of Sargassum as he found them. Krümmel, by contrast, mapped his own perceptions of the distribution of Sargassum in tints of vivid green “by the aid of steam,” as the <em>Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society</em> reported on Krümmel’s 1891 publication in <em>Petermanns</em>. By this, they refer to Krümmel’s main data source, which were the logs of many German steam ships that recorded the presence and densities of Sargassum as they steamed across the Atlantic. Krümmel synthesized the mass of data to make the first reasonably accurate map of the Sargasso Sea. His enterprise was published in 1891; in a certain sense it is an early example of maritime crowdsourcing.</p>

<h3>Sound in the Water like Light in the Air</h3>
<p>Ferdinand Hassler’s Survey of the Coast became the US Coast Survey, and in 1878 was renamed the US Coast and Geodetic Survey, although the Survey was clearly “geodetic” from the beginning. The Survey began working cooperatively with the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1871, long before the “annexation” of the Kingdom into the United States. But the Survey’s mandate included mapping the territorial waters of the nation, so from about 1900 on, first the Survey, and now NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, has produced nautical charts of the Hawaiian Island, which is really a great arced archipelago of volcanic islands and fringing coral reefs. The <a href="/navigating-the-coasts-and-seas/1934-us-coast-survey-chart-hawaii#top">1934 version of the Survey’s chart of the Hawaiian Islands</a> displays many features of the profound changes in mapping and navigational technologies that were introduced in the early twentieth century.</p>
<p>In 1901, the Submarine Signal Company was formed to produce underwater bells for the US Light Service, to produce horizontally transmitted sound to warn ships of approaching dangers. In 1910, the company hired the brilliant inventor-engineer Reginald Fessenden, who devised oscillators to magnify the sounds and their ranges. Following the disaster of the sinking of the Titanic in 1912, Fessenden and other scientists at the company explored using pulses of underwater sound to reflect off icebergs and return to the transmitting ship, thereby providing warnings of an iceberg ahead. They discovered, though, that the sound would also reflect off the ocean bottom and return to the transmitting ship. Given accurate knowledge of the speed of sound transmission through sea water, which is itself a complex subject, they realized it would be possible to estimate the depth of the water to the bottom below. After the First World War, Herbert Dorsey invented the fathometer, the first precise depth finding device. Dorsey joined the Coast and Geodetic Survey, and by the late 1920s, the Survey was using fathometers to measure deep water depths rapidly and accurately, thereby completely eliminating the need for stopping a Survey ship for lead-line soundings of the bottom. The fathometers worked as the ship steamed ahead. The pronounced patterning of lines of numbers on the Hawaiian nautical chart represents the tracks followed by the Survey ships as they steamed in uniform configurations around the main set of islands, or steamed toward and back from isolated islands, such as Palmyra Island, south of the main set of Hawaiian Islands. Note as well the influence of radio on the Hawaiian chart. The chart shows two radio beacon stations, represented by red circles, one on Kauai and one on Oahu. Navy and commercial ships and planes with directional radio equipment could “fly the beam” broadcast by the radio beacon to determine their positions relative to the stations from far out of sight of the islands.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>We began this essay on navigating the coasts and oceans of Earth with an engraving of human and wind-powered boats offshore from the volcano Vesuvius, and brought it along to the stage of a now historic marine chart of the Hawaiian Islands, which used sonar signals to determine water depths, the now universal standard for sounding. At this very moment, the premier long-distance deep sea voyaging canoe Hōkūle‘a, built by the members of the Polynesian Voyaging Society, having left the waters of the Pacific Ocean, crossed the Indian Ocean past the Cape of Good Hope of Africa into the Atlantic Ocean, where it is visiting ports of call in South and later North America, before crossing the Atlantic to Europe, to stop in Portugal and into the Mediterranean Sea to Italy, to the very places where the great sea voyages—in the Western tradition—began. The crew of the Hōkūle‘a navigate entirely by what many Westerners consider non-instrument wayfinding, bereft of all the technologies described and illustrated in this essay. But another way to describe their work is that the dome of the sky and the changing waters around them have become their instrument. Hōkūle‘a, or the Star of Gladness, refers to the star called Arcturus, which is at times a zenith star for the Hawaiian Islands, meaning directly overhead. Hōkūle‘a “works” in navigation in relation to the sidereal Star Compass, which is a mental construct. In the Star Compass, the visual horizon is divided into thirty-two “houses” along the horizon, each of the houses separated from the others by 11.25 degrees of arc, forming the complete circle of 360 degrees. But this 32-part division is exactly the same as the compass rose, previously discussed, without the use of the compass! So now we come, literally, full circle! People can navigate well or badly, and everyone gets lost at times, but even so, there are many ways to navigate.</p>

<h3>Further Reading</h3>
<p>There are essentially two levels to this discussion of historic and contemporary aids to coast-wise and maritime navigation: (1) books, websites, and other aids designed to assist one directly in learning specific techniques or exercises in navigation; (2) resources that are “about” the history and evolution of navigation and its aids. Members of the second group are actually critical to those of the first group, however, because they help one “make sense” of techniques and their histories, which in turn increases one’s facility with the techniques. One of the few resources that really attempts to function in both groups is physicist John Huth’s <em>The Lost Art of Finding Our Way</em>, which gives broad instruction in many aspects of relatively instrument-less navigation and way-finding in both terrestrial and aquatic environments, with much attention to the underlying dynamics of the earthly systems along with simplified but reasonably accurate histories of evolving marine craft and sail and hull designs, and their attendant systems of navigation. Huth perhaps attempts to cover too much in one volume, but his approach is excellent, and the reader will gain a useful perspective that can be applied to more focused aids to navigation.</p>
<p>As to aids themselves, navigation is increasingly bifurcating between systems based primarily or entirely on electronics, and everything else. That means that one’s vessel, and equipment and objectives, will largely determine what kind of navigational aids and instructions to pursue. But recall that, until the very early twentieth century, all navigation was non-electronic, and many contemporary navigational realms remain so today, most famously the great revival of traditional Polynesian navigation and way-finding systems of recent decades. A good gateway resource is: <a href="https:/web.archive.org/web/20201024174049/http:/www.celestialnavigation.net/" rel="nofollow">http:/www.celestialnavigation.net</a> and specifically the many other URLs listed under its section on “resources”. Note under that page that one of the recommended books is <em>Celestial Navigation for Yachtsmen</em>, revised and still in print, which was written by Mary Blewitt, whose 1957 history of nautical charting Surveys of the Seas is still one of the indispensible group two resources on the history of navigational systems. Hence, Mary Blewitt was spanning both groups well over half a century ago.</p>
<p>For navigation in and around American waters and seas, the NOAA Office of Coast Survey, the direct successor to Ferdinand Hassler’s Survey of the Coast, is the main gateway to nautical aids. Their URL: <a href="https:/web.archive.org/web/20201024174049/http:/www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/" rel="nofollow">http:/www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/</a> A very useful downloadable resource there is Chart No. 1, which describes and depicts the nautical chart symbology sets of all the major systems of nautical navigation charts: <a href="https:/web.archive.org/web/20201024174049/http:/www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/mcd/chartno1.htm" rel="nofollow">http:/www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/mcd/chartno1.htm</a> As to coast-wise navigation in American waters, in 1867 the Coast Survey acquired the copyright and properties of Blunt’s <em>American Coast Pilot</em>, which remains in print continuously since 1796. There are now many regional volumes covering the vast American watery worlds: <a href="https:/web.archive.org/web/20201024174049/http:/www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/nsd/cpdownload.htm" rel="nofollow">http:/www.nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/nsd/cpdownload.htm</a></p>
<p>Finally, with reference to the more non-electronic systems of navigation: generally speaking, the smaller the vessel, the more likely that its pilot will depend more non-electronic aids to way-finding and navigation. Stores and websites that cater to sea kayakers and small sailboats, for example, will yield useful tools, not the least of which will be formal or informal instruction and lessons from local experts, who have often been, since time immemorial, the most important aids to navigation themselves. Good luck, and bon voyage!</p>

  return `<p>In 1922, Berkeley student Frances Toor dedicated her MA thesis on the Moquí people of Spanish New Mexico to Professor Herbert Eugene Bolton for “introducing me to the interesting study of Spanish documents, [which] opened for me new horizons in the study of American History.” Toor, whose interests in folklore soon took her to Mexico and a career guiding American tourists, shared Bolton’s vision of the interconnected history of the Americas. After integrating the Spanish borderlands of North America into US history Bolton called for studies of hemispheric parallels and connections. His vision may have been radical in early twentieth-century North American academic circles, but not to readers of José Enríquez Rodó (<em>Ariel</em>, 1900) and other Latin American scholars whose <em>americanismo</em> was wary of an increasingly influential and internationalist United States but did not rule out a hemispheric consciousness, nor the more contemporary hemispheric histories of Historians like Felipe Fernández Armesto (2005). In fact, this Americanist perspective would have been very familiar to those who, since Martin Waldseemüller dubbed the lands of the New World “America” in his 1507 world map, represented the hemisphere as a continent or fourth part of a world formerly thought to have three: Africa, Europe and Asia (Lois 2012).</p>
<p>North Americans and Europeans have traveled around, over, and through Latin America since Columbus set foot in the Caribbean, creating or using maps to show their paces, paddles, and pit stops. Since achieving independence in the nineteenth century, Latin Americans have also “mapped back,” offering their own visions of linkages between the Americas and beyond. This essay offers a selection from the vast and diverse cartographies of movement by land, sea, and air, mapping the hemisphere’s enduring geographical and human connections.</p>
<p>What connects the maps introduced below—all part of the Newberry Library’s impressive holdings—is their circulation among a general public between the era of the 1823 US Monroe Doctrine and Simón Bolívar’s 1826 Congress of Panama to the Good Neighbor policy and foundation of the Organization of American States in 1948. Whether produced by governments, corporations, artists, scholars, or journalists for use in atlases, advertising or en route, these popular maps demonstrate how Americans of all kinds traveled specifically for business and pleasure, war and peace, and, always, to discover, explore, and know the Americas just a little better.</p>
<p>It is impossible in ten maps to offer a comprehensive collection of cartography of conquest, colonization, commodities, commerce, or communication between the Americas. Aiming smaller, this essay and its maps focus on three big ideas—exploration, extraction, and experience—which many maps from these places and the long nineteenth century presented to the men, women, and children who moved in the hemisphere during Latin America’s first independent century. Road maps, atlases, newspaper and magazine articles, advertisements, corporate brochures, travel accounts, geography books, and government reports will reward those inclined to investigate further with many more possibilities of finding routes to, through, and around the hemisphere.</p>

<h3>Sea: Around the Coasts</h3>
<p>The sea brought Europeans and their descendants to the Americas in the sixteenth century, where they struggled to find easy overland routes and instead sought out river travel from the Mississippi to the Amazon to ease tough inland journeys. Sea charts since this period have offered a particular “coastal vision” of the lands reached, and for eighteenth-century Latin America emphasized both getting to the shores and getting around them, whether to move French military and trading vessels around and between French overseas territories as the manuscript <em>Cartes Marines</em> (1726) (<a href="/around-over-through/1726-louisiana-mexico#top">See Map 9</a>) reveal, or to track the routes of whaling vessels such as that of James Colnett of Britain’s Royal Navy (1798). Small-scale charts tended to follow portolan tradition and concentrated geographic information at the shore—naming river mouths, sholas, and harbors that pilots might look for—while larger scale maps would fill in fortifications, information of potential opposition (reported “anthropophages,” or cannibals, in the case of a <em>Cartes Marine</em> chart of the Louisiana coast).</p>
<p>Sea charts, however, don’t tell the full story of the importance of water as a means of moving people, products, and projects in the Americas. Land maps of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries both inscribed the seabornee history of exploration and conquest and showed successive coastal and river routes, sometimes in the same map. In the region, Agustín Codazzi’s 1840 <em>Atlas de Venezuela</em> (<a href="/around-over-through/1840-atlas-venezuela#top">See Map 1</a>), a pioneering Latin American national atlas, included Columbus, Cortes’s and Pizarro’s routes of exploration and conquest for sixteenth-century Spain on a geographic map ostensibly devoted to the hemisphere’s contemporary political and demographic makeup. He also brought readers up to date on contemporary sea exploration. On the same map, Codazzi plotted two contemporary journeys in North America. The United States’ Lewis and Clark Expedition of 1806, which followed the Missouri and Columbia Rivers to reach the Pacific Ocean in North America. Commercially-inspired scientific exploration by British sailors John Franklin, John Ross and Alexander Mackenzie sought in the 1810s and 1820s to find the elusive northwest passage and magnetic north. Codazzi, himself a former Napoleonic officer, seemed to be comparing sixteenth and nineteenth century waterborne imperialisms from the safety of Venezuela, his adopted home. Was he making an argument finding equivalence between those coming to the region to conquer and those seeking ways through it in search of a transcontinental route and Northwest Passage?</p>
<p>Turn of the twentieth-century maps with sea routes produced for Latin American publics tended to highlight neither exploration nor conquest but two established and modern moneymaking ventures for the region: Commerce and tourism. The Brazilian Ministry of Industry’s 1908 commercial map (<a href="/around-over-through/1908-united-brazil#top">See Map 5</a>) eschewed showing waterborne exploration in favor of a naked message about the sea’s importance to commercialism. The map commemorated a century of open ports, pointedly naming international shipping partners and marking their routes to Europe, Asia, and Africa, as well as North America, and identifying national river, coastal and international steamship companies. Such nationally-sponsored maps touted Latin America’s accessibility by ocean highways when printed at home, like Brazil’s map, or abroad. Richard Mayer of New York’s 1920 “Commercial Map” of Colombia (Mayer 1920) pointedly showed an active Caribbean coast steamer network, British, French, Dutch and other companies transiting the newly-opened Panama Canal, and also directed readers inland to the country’s navigable rivers and extended railway network, along with a few ropeways.</p>
<p>Nineteenth- and twentieth-century North American mapmakers, too, devoted energy to mapping routes and transport possibility for Latin America’s waters. In the 1850s, the US Navy explored and hoped to exploit the Amazon and River Plate regions by turning rivers into international waterways; nationalism and environmental and technological challenges quickly ended that initiative. By 1905, the United States was creating its own waterway, the Panama Canal, to increase economic, political, and strategic influence. Businesses investing in and exporting coffee, bananas, nitrates, and other raw materials founded steamship companies that earned extra money by contracting to carry the US mail and passengers. Their brochures and glossy magazine spreads often sported maps alongside illustrations inviting visitors to experience a relief from winter, or a romantic break. Montevideo-born California-based artist Jo Mora’s 1933 vignettes of conquistadors and annotations next to galleons drawn on the seas in a seriously entertaining poster “carte” or map for the cruise company Grace Lines, is just one example (<a href="/around-over-through/1933-ye-olde-spanish#top">See Map 3</a>). Mora’s illustrations offer a counterpoint to Codazzi’s route-focused depiction of Spanish exploration. In addition, Moras’s inset map of the Panama Canal, a highlight of the steamer journey, touts the miles saved when this engineering marvel and new water route opened in 1914. Notably absent are the routes plied by Grace’s North American and European competitors seen in the Brazilian map, an important silence to consider when thinking about the contributions of privately-sponsored maps to our understanding of American mobilities (<a href="/around-over-through/1950-panorama-american#top">See Map 8</a>).</p>

<h3>Land and Air: Across Desert and Jungle, Over the Mountains</h3>
<p>If sea charts and cruise lines focused attention on getting to and around the Americas by water, land maps drew in those needing to enter and cross sometimes-challenging terrain. Cartographic emphasis and content differed substantially depending on which means of transportation a map described: Walking or riding a mule or horse leads to a different cartographic perspective and relationship with the land than riding in machine-age transportation. Although railroad and highway routes might be similar to footpaths and carriageways, trains and automobiles generally transformed land from a barrier into a comfortable, efficient means of communication and commerce (Salvatore 2006).</p>
<p>The difference in the two perspectives comes through clearly when comparing North American maps reporting on a military expedition to still-Spanish Santa Fe and Los Angeles in 1846 (<a href="/around-over-through/1848-military-leavenworth#top">See Map 10</a>), a Boston writer’s railway journey only a decade later (<a href="/around-over-through/1855-panama-rr#top">See Map 7</a>), and an English-language motorists’ guide book, produced by former student and expatriate guide Frances Toor in Mexico almost eighty years later (<a href="/around-over-through/1938-motorists-mexico#top">See Map 4</a>). The journals and maps of the topographic engineers in the US Army of the West, tasked with mapping the Santa Fé trail as well as their battles with the Mexican Army in 1846-1847, address explorer’s hardships and uncertainties (water, shelter, vulnerability to attack) that not only Lewis and Clark but Alvar Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca, Alexander MacKenzie, or any other explorer of the day would have found wearily familiar. Information about where to pasture supply animals or take on water was perhaps as valuable as taking accurate measurements to place settlements on the map. In contrast, Robert Tomes in 1855 on the Panama Railroad and Frances Toor in 1933 presenting Mexico’s new highways, could draw on existing data or maps to demonstrate how rail and later motor travel would enhance a passenger’s experience. The maps (and commentary) by Tomes, written when North Americans were still migrating West, and by Toor, when they were heading south on vacation, were geared at those who might travel for business or pleasure.</p>
<p>In addition to maps of land travel that sought to open new paths or make known paths easier to follow, others retraced steps and even presented solutions to academic riddles. In the eighteenth century, scientists Charles Marie de la Condamine, Antonio Ulloa, and Jorge Juan helped the French and Spanish crowns determine the shape of the earth, and Alexander von Humboldt drew on his travels in the Americas to provide a new theory of nature. By the mid- nineteenth century archaeologists from Frenchman Philippe François de la Renaudière in Mexico, American John Lloyd Stephens in the Yucatán and Honduras, and Briton Clements Markham in Perú uncovered Mayan and Inca ruins, medicinal plants, and novel flora and fauna. They plotted and published maps and plans of ruins and their routes of travel in popular and scholarly journals, as well as in bestselling travel accounts. Such explorations (and the maps they produced) continued into the twentieth century, when the hardships of walking were a welcome challenge and opportunity to revisit history, rather than a daunting impediment. Thus, Hiram Bingham, more famous for a later expedition that recovered Machu Picchu, opted to retrace a prior expedition’s route in 1906 to decide whether Simón Bolívar really had led exploits as impressive as those of Hannibal and Napoléon crossing the Alps when he led campaigns over the cordilleras of the Andes. The map of his mountainous route (<a href="/around-over-through/1909-route-bogota#top">See Map 2</a>) might thus have more in common with that of military mapping than a tourist route, even though the privations he underwent were of his own devising (as he avoided the regular well-supplied routes that Bolívar, too, had to skip in order to surprise the enemy).</p>
<p>Mountains, in fact, were the biggest obstacle to transiting the Americas by land, complicating everything from military maneuvers to freight transport to railroad construction. So it was the third dimension that provided a solution: Mapping by and from the air commenced in the 1920s, providing the fastest and (eventually) easiest route from urban North America to urban South America, stopping at military and rural landing strips on the way. Maps of these air routes—to celebrate them in newspaper or glossy magazine stories and to entice travelers with them in airline company brochures—borrowed from conventions developed for rail and auto travel, generally giving attention to the supposedly straight lines linking stops on the route and emptying the map space of all geographic referents except points of departure and arrival, with the occasional punctuation of a particularly dramatic mountain whose impressive height the airplane could scale (<a href="/around-over-through/1929-airmail-argentina#top">See Map 6</a>).</p>

<h3>Mobilizing Movement</h3>
<p>The maps that comprise this section were produced in a time of technological, political and economic developments that transformed the hemisphere. A little bit of background should help put the maps not only in conversation with each other, but with their time period.</p>
<p>In the early nineteenth century, all of mainland America faced important transitions: Political independence, renegotiated political systems, alliances, and territorial extent. By the end of the century, stability had been achieved, but the first half of the century was rocky; the United States experienced the War of 1812 and Civil War, while Latin American countries experienced numerous internal and international conflicts and dissolutions of federations into smaller countries. Initially, despite the Monroe Doctrine’s “keep out” message, European powers exercised extensive soft power and were Latin America’s principal sources of investment, exchange and technology. When the United States took over building the Panama Canal from the French, however, a baton was passed; engineering not just a pathway between the oceans but also the independence of Panama confirmed the arrival of North America as a Hunter (Teddy Roosevelt), presciently recognized by Nicaraguan nationalist Ruben Darío in “Ode to Roosevelt” (1904) as joining the cults of Mammon (wealth) and Hercules (power). This Hunter would not hesitate to behave as the region’s “policeman” putting “boots on the ground” in the circum-Caribbean repeatedly until the early 1930s. José Enríquez Rodo’s 1900 essay <em>Ariel</em> put the divide in terms of “spirit” against “matter,” and was as a basis of a Latin American solidarity set in opposition (at times) to the American vision.</p>
<p>US versions of Pan-Americanism, and three “Pan-American transportation utopias” described below, undergirded this expansionism. The US had been skeptical about Bolívar’s Spanish American-driven Pan-Americanism in 1826, when it was just one small English-speaking country in a Spanish- or Portuguese-speaking community of nations. But its policy changed upon growing into a continental power. From the 1880s, the US promoted and participated in the meetings of the Pan-American Conference and promoted subsequent regional institutions, including the Pan American Geographic and History Institute (1928). Its Latin American neighbors interpreted this interest as both contribution and threat. Fostering hemispheric projects that advanced its own strategic, economic and political interests, the US unsuccessfully advocated for a Pan-American Railway system in the 1880s but got traction for a Pan-American Highway (largely built from 1925 to 1945) and Pan-American air routes (accomplished by 1929) (Salvatore 2006, 666-679). Each project led to surveys and mapmaking, national and transnational, official and popular. The US government also enlisted mapmakers to help sell its policies. If Latin American companies or individuals based in Latin America, like Frances Toor in Mexico were selling the American public guidebooks with road maps of Latin America by the 1920s, the Postwar hemispheric “Good Neighbor” initiative brought the major US road map producers into the circuit.</p>
<p>Economically, this period was a boom time in the Americas. Between 1850 and 1913, Latin American exports grew 1000%, making up about 5-8% of global trade and about a third of all tropical exports, for only about 3-4% of the overall population. However, the impact of economic growth and mechanization was uneven. In 1890, Brazil surpassed Japan in per capita wealth and was about equal to Russia, while by 1914, Argentina was one of the world’s five richest countries. However, in 1913, the wealth of thirteen of Latin America’s twenty countries derived from just a single product, and five countries—Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Cuba and Mexico—earned over 80% of it. Foreign investment—largely British, French and German in the early nineteenth century, transitioning to North American by the close of World War I—brought capital and new infrastructure, but tended to benefit home offices and enclaves and not society as a whole, and was also subject to international market fluctuations. Additionally, imported engineers, locomotives, railway stock and other finished products did not contribute appreciably to industrialization (Topik and Allen 1998, 8-11; Halsey 1914, Appendices 1 and 2).</p>
<p>As Latin America became increasingly integrated into world commerce, transportation’s mechanization meant foreigners and products on the move into and out of Latin America spent decreasing amounts of time on a journey. In the first half of the nineteenth century, most North Americans were more interested in traveling across or around Latin America than to it; faster transportation methods meant that they spent less and less time in the region they transited. Tens of thousands of US citizens just wanted to pass through, choosing to cross Panama or Nicaragua rather than the US overland route during the gold rush. Traveling by wagon from Independence, Missouri to Sacramento, California in 1850 could take up to four months, a journey that could only be undertaken in summer. The Panama Railroad reduced interoceanic transit from about four days to five hours in 1855 and three hours by 1860, for up to 1500 persons and the freight of three steamships; steamship travel on either end completed the whole trip in around three weeks (Otis 1867, 56, 161), about half the time needed to sail around Cape Horn. Europeans and North Americans who did come to explore, to seek ancient civilizations, invest or participate in one of the many internal and international conflicts, or to map, like Codazzi in Venezuela and Colombia, Richard Schomburgk in Guayana, and Maximiliano von Sonnenstern in Central America, could be counted by the dozens or hundreds, not the thousands.</p>
<p>Helped by the faster transportation, a sea (and air) change was also taking place. As boats got sturdier, safer, and swifter, the tropics began their transition in outsiders’ eyes from insalubrious traps to healthful and relaxing resorts. The Caribbean, Mexico, and Central America were both faster and easier to reach than South America, and more popular destinations for North American travelers.</p>
<p>For those headed to the Caribbean, the increase of investors and visitors was perhaps most noticeable in Cuba, where the number of US-flagged vessels visiting annually more than tripled from 1800 to 1852, from 606 to 1886, as US businessmen invested in sugar plantations and copper mines, as merchants opened restaurants, hotels, and retail stores, as engineers and machinists worked on railroads and sugar processing. Tourists soon followed. Richard Henry Dana and Julia Ward Howe respectively published their impressions of a “vacation voyage” and a “trip” to Cuba in 1859 and 1860, in steamships that reached the Caribbean in less than a week. Helped by improvements in sanitation and services, North Americans stopped fearing the Caribbean tropics as unhealthy and began to plot winter trips for their therapeutic benefits, although it would be a few generations before the sun and beaches, rather than the mountain air and springs, became the principal attraction. Lou Perez Jr. puts the annual mid-nineteenth century influx of United States visitors at 5000 per year. Nor was Cuba alone; Jamaica went from “record” arrivals of 500 foreigners in 1873 to having 20,000 in 1895 brought by a single operator (Taylor 1993, 4). By 1949, Bermuda expected 60,000 tourists, and with air travel, tourism became the “largest single factor in the economic development of the Caribbean.” By 1960 a million tourists brought in $140m to the Caribbean, more than the “total US foreign aid to all Latin America.”</p>
<p>Mexico and Central America also grew as destinations for international tourism. By 1937, the New York Times reported reaching Guatemala City from New York City in twenty-four hours. Americans, beginning with Prohibition, increasingly found Mexico by bus and car, and kept coming; by 1950, Mexico received over $135m in tourist business. Still, those numbers are relative; in 1930, only 4% of “Uncle Sam’s Tourists” opted for Latin America over Western Europe, where they spent the other 90% of the billion dollars expended on foreign travel. In 1954, Latin America received only about 3% of the $1 billion that Americans spent on travel a year, and even this went primarily to areas “north of the canal.”</p>
<p>South America, even in the early years of air travel, took days and weeks to reach from the North, and few tourists made the effort. In 1921, Grace Log of Grace Lines reported that American-flag carriers’ passengers from New York reached the Panama Canal six days later, Lima in another week, and Valparaiso, Chile after twenty days; those headed to Buenos Aires faced another three days of railroad travel over the Andes. Plane service shortened the trip to less than a week by the early 1930s, yet did not expand as quickly or rapidly as expected. In South America, however, fewer tourist attractions—ruins, spas, or great cultural centers—or resort destinations beckoned. In 1922, a US businessman’s guide estimated the number of North Americans living in South America at 3000 for the continent, and as late as 1949, Mexico was raking in $90 million a year when Brazil only received $6 million from tourists to carnival. In 1959, Pan Am still flew only twice a week to Buenos Aires, taking over fourteen hours, although it had daily service to Venezuela where travelers could take connecting flights. Not until 1960 did the flight from New York to Rio drop from a full day and night to nine hours.</p>
<p>If few North Americans vacationed in the southern cone, however, it is important to remember that South America, principally Brazil and Argentina, attracted millions of immigrants from Europe, primarily from Spain, Portugal, and Italy. These aspirants filled berths in European steam lines’ western crossings, much as Gold Rush migrants had filled North American boats. And millions traveled within the Americas, although more often for work than for pleasure. The Panama Canal project and many Central American banana farms relied on West Indian laborers, who were more mobile than one might expect. Alejandro Miranda, a working-class Nicaraguan, traveled from the late 1870s to early 1900s by land working odd jobs throughout Central America as a young man, was a railroad engineer in Mexico and Cuba, and returned to Nicaragua to operate a telegraph office, worked as a journalist throughout Central America, and was later a railroad engineer in Cuba. Like fellow telegrapher and Colombian novelist Gabriel García Márquez’s father, he was just one of the many Latin Americans whose mobility expanded with the railroad and communication. Some, like José Martí, even worked in the US for a while, sometimes (like Martí) driven into exile by political conditions. Even though freight, not passengers, inspired the construction of most Latin American railways, they still carried substantial and growing numbers between city and countryside. Argentina transported 750,000 people and 71,500 metric tons of freight over 154 miles of railroad in 1865; by 1912, with over 20,000 miles of rail (the world’s ninth longest system), 68 million passengers and almost 34 million metric tons of freight, it was a powerhouse; by that time, Colombia’s lines carried more than a million passengers a year, and Henry Meigg’s railway in Peru over 2.4m passengers in 1912/13. (Halsey 1914)</p>
<p>With so much personal, commercial, and official interaction between the Americas by the 1930s, when railroad, steamship, automobile, and airline linked capitals and hinterlands and moved people in and out, as well as around, the hemisphere, is it any wonder that North Americans began to think hemispherically? As early as 1932, Herbert E. Bolton, in his presidential address to the American Historical Association, argued that the “increasing importance of inter-American relations makes imperative a better understanding by each of the history and culture of all.” Bolton posited the common chronology in the Western Hemisphere of European discovery, exploration and colonization, succeeded by nations “striving on the one hand for national solidarity, political stability, and economic well-being, and on the other hand for a satisfactory adjustment of relations with each other and with the rest of the world” (Bolton, 1932, 448-9). While it took until 2005 for Felipe Fernández Armesto to publish <em>The Americas: A Hemispheric History</em>, by 1952 at least one individual was hitting the road to test that theory—even if he was doing so unaware. Ernesto “Che” Guevara and Alberto Granados on “La Poderosa” were Argentine students motorcycling and then hitchhiking from Argentina to Venezuela, Miami, and back. It would be interesting to know if any of the maps that envisioned a Pan-American geography inspired the journey or were used in planning the trip. Certainly, the middle-class Guevara household would have had access to such materials.</p>

<p>It is impossible in ten maps to offer a comprehensive collection of cartography of conquest, colonization, commodities, commerce, or communication between the Americas. Aiming smaller, this essay and its maps have chosen to focus on three big ideas: Exploration, extraction and experience, which many maps from these places and this period presented to the men, women and children who moved in the hemisphere during Latin America’s first independent century. Road maps, atlases, newspaper and magazine articles, advertisements, corporate brochures, travel accounts, geography books, government reports will reward those inclined to travel, to explore, and to investigate further with many more possibilities of finding routes to, through, and around the hemisphere.</p>

  return `<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>It is perhaps a problem with maps that, for objects so closely associated with human movement, they provide only a limited sense of movement themselves. They mark former movement, certainly, and they propose new routes, but to study a map is to study a portrait of the world at a moment in time. We can see the routes and roads of a particular era but we can gain little sense of how those travel corridors themselves moved and shifted across the landscape as humans changed and altered their world. Complex and fascinating as historic maps are, they can only provide a glimpse of the dynamic human movements that have crossed the landscape, particularly as most of us study maps within certain circumscribed time periods or regions. We specialize in area, time, and genre and leave it to our colleagues to provide backstory or codas to our work. Utilizing the written and visual records of our time periods, we can build some sense of the experience of moving through the landscapes that our maps depict, if we so choose. But we lose the longer picture that all human movements are part of ongoing and ever-shifting patterns in history.</p>
<p>Looking at maps in succession, however reveals in a powerful way how important human movement is to the landscape. Rather than adjusting themselves to an existing landscape, human movements shape, warp, and rearrange the terrain. Transportation networks have proven surprisingly ephemeral and mutable, even at the regional levels. These shifts and leaps across landmasses have made accurately recreating historic routes difficult, to say the least. But if specific routes are difficult to trace, historic maps do provide an excellent resource for tracing general corridors of movement and migration across a region. Despite maps’ disconnection from the actual experience of moving through the landscape at any one moment in time, historic maps viewed in succession can demonstrate how humans, towns, even states respond to the shifts in economies and cultures across time. There was very little “natural” about these routes; nor did they subtly fade into each other. While routes continued from era to era, they did not overlap as much as one might expect. Observing how a cartographic generation’s aspirations become the next’s secondary features, one can get some sense of how many dreams became reality and how those realities become memories. Moreover, maps tended to arrive in periods of transition—the circumstances creating new maps simultaneously creating the shifts in politics and economics that would demand new maps a few years later.</p>
<p>These shifts are most evident at a distance. Towns and cities of course change shape constantly even without significant changes in overall patterns of movement across a region. But at the state or regional level, one gets a much clearer picture of how long-distance travel arranged and shaped the overall face of the country. In the case of Georgia, it is possible to discern how peoples’ movements across the state responded quite sensitively to regional political, economic, and demographic shifts. They emerge as a slow shift of routes across time and across space, viewable only across decades, but viewable nonetheless. As Georgians oriented themselves from roads to rivers and then from rails to remembrance, they slowly changed the physical routes by which travelers could move through the state. A study of mapping in Georgia between 1775 and 1975 thus reveals something of how people of that region altered their travels through the state and, in doing so, altered and altered again the entirety of the southeastern corner of North America in the two centuries after independence. Beginning with maps of the Indian trade that shaped the colonial economy and proceeding through the era of plantations and on into the New South, the maps of Georgia show a region where travel changed quite a bit, not just in the technologies of conveyance but in the very different corridors through which people traveled.</p>
${validate_component(Image, "Image").$$render($$result, { index: "1" }, {}, {})}
<h3>Following the Paths of the Colonial Era</h3>
<p>For most of the colonial period, maps followed in the wake of travelers. Explorers, voyagers, naturalists, and surveyors crossed the face of North America and drew their maps as records of their movements, seeking to lay imperial claims on both space and knowledge. But the corridors they traveled had been etched by centuries of Native American movements—the complex and changing networks of paths and trails that governed movement in the American interior. These mapmakers were thus circumscribed by what other humans had created. Shared pathways were the most effective means of long-distance, overland travel.</p>
<p>A pathway such as the main trading path between Augusta and the lands of the Lower Creek Indians was just such a deeply etched corridor of travel and a crucial transportation route in the colonial Southeast. The important combinations of geology, human technology, and Anglo-Indian politics defined the path’s route for most of the eighteenth century. Geologically, the path ran along the boundary between the rocky and hilly grounds of the Appalachian Piedmont and the softer and sandier soils of the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plains. This geologic boundary proved important for human travel when the main modes of conveyance were by foot and by hoof. The fall zones of this geological boundary made for easier passage across southeastern rivers in most seasons (spring floods made crossing difficult even at these shallows). (De Vorsey 1986, 5-10)</p>
<p>But it was the Yamassee War of 1715 that made this travel route central to Southeastern affairs. The brief but destructive war rearranged the human geography of the Southeast, with a number of Creek villages removing westward to the Chattahoochee River valley and English traders establishing a new outpost at the falls of the Savannah River. From 1715 on, a regular movement of humans, horses, and trading goods followed the pathway along the fall line. Daily trade, war parties, and diplomatic missions all followed this same basic route for decades, creating one of the most important travel corridors in North America.</p>
<p>Important as it was, the route went largely unmapped until late in the colonial period. It appeared mostly as an abstract line on European and Indian maps alike. Only in 1775 did Europeans attempt to systematically map the pathways of the Southeast. Responding to British calls for greater oversight in the region and Indian acquiescence to the British demand for mapped boundaries, Superintendent for Indian Affairs John Stuart deputized a number of surveyors to travel southeastern paths and record their twists and turns as precisely as possible. (Paulett 2012, 55-56)</p>
<p>The result was one of the most ambitious and significant maps from colonial America. Never printed, <a href="/lines-that-fracture/1775-southern-indian-district-of-north-america#top">the 1775 Stuart-Purcell manuscript map</a> is a treasure trove for colonial scholars. The map covers the entirety of mainland North America south of the Ohio River and east of the Mississippi. On this map, Stuart had his deputies map as precisely as possible the locations and names of all political features within the region: colonial boundaries, roads, and towns; Indian villages and paths; and even proposed colonial settlement schemes west of the Appalachians. It also incorporated the major surveys of the East and West Florida coasts commissioned by the British government in the years after 1763. The product of a decade’s worth of surveys and negotiations, it was a major leap forward in the precise measurement and plotting of the Southeast and its peoples.</p>
<p>For all of its ambitions to be a total map of the Southeast, however, the Stuart-Purcell map could only be a detailed path map where the American interior was concerned. Revealing in stark detail the limits of European knowledge of the region, the mapmakers could only trace the steps of the thousands of people who had carved the route from Augusta to the Chattahoochee. (For whatever combination of political, logistical, or informational reasons, the map omitted the more heavily traveled branch of the path that connected the Ogeechee River crossing to the populous Upper Creek villages.) The surveyors could therefore only map what they saw as they moved along the paths. The large river systems of the Ogeechee, Ocmulgee, and Flint Rivers and their major branches were sketched in, but the most detailed hydrography could only be found at those places where these large systems intersected with the trading path. But, by following the paths of the traders, Stuart’s surveyors provided a helpful glimpse of the decades-old trade corridor at the very moment that it was about to begin to disappear as a major transportation route in the Southeast.</p>
<p>The circumstances that created the Stuart-Purcell map ensured that no further maps would be made for a long time. The series of land cessions and boundary lines that the map sought to define and depict also led to an unfolding series of conflicts in Georgia that would ultimately reorganize the Indian trade and lead to an entirely new nation. Beginning in 1774, factions of Creek warriors opposed the land deals that elder Creek diplomats had negotiated and began attacking settlers in the “New Purchase” lands north and west of Augusta. These conflicts would ultimately help determine the origins and course of the Revolution in Georgia. (Cashin 1985, 245-247) Traders, most of them Loyalists, abandoned Georgia and reestablished their businesses along the Gulf Coast. Increasingly the old trading path became an official link between United States and Creek Indian agents, but the changing politics of early America also altered travel routes through Georgia.</p>
${validate_component(Image, "Image").$$render($$result, { index: "2" }, {}, {})}
<h3>The Persistence of Paths in the Age of Re-Settlement</h3>
<p>Somewhat surprisingly, these conflicts actually helped to preserve the old trading path as an important travel corridor well into the 1810s. Even though it took four decades for another map of Georgia to appear, <a href="/lines-that-fracture/1818-map-of-the-state-of-georgia#top">Daniel Sturges’s 1818 Map of the State of Georgia</a> revealed that the old cross-state travel route had not vanished entirely. Between 1775 and 1818, Georgia had witnessed the disruptions of the Revolution, the confusion of Creek-Georgia land deals in the 1790s, and a general uptick in hostilities between aggrieved Creeks and pushy Georgia settlers. Reforming its land policy in the wake of the Yazoo frauds, Georgia undertook a series of regular land lotteries and detailed surveys in the early 1800s under the direction of Sturges, Georgia’s Surveyor General between 1797 and 1809 and again between 1817 and 1823. Caught up in the cotton boom, Georgia’s boundaries shifted rapidly as the state steadily appropriated lands from the Creeks and Cherokees. Sturges himself was part victim of Georgia’s rapid changes, serving a brief stint in jail for debt, his economic woes further delaying the production of his state map, the first original state map since Stuart-Purcell. (Cadle 1991, 154-158, 168-173, 180fn.-181fn.)</p>
<p>Amid all this bustle in the map’s background, it would be easy to lose sight of the old trading path, but the old route still remained an imprint on Sturges’s map. Despite Sturges’s close ties to Georgia’s “cartography of settlement” which emphasized regular property surveys to affix permanent ownership, the map still revealed much of the old path-based “cartography of movement” that had characterized the Stuart-Purcell map. The inclusion of the old route no doubt had much to do with efforts to convert the old trading roads into federal roads in the early nineteenth century. US negotiations with the Creeks included much discussion of how to incorporate Creek territory into the growing national concern with maintaining an east-west highway through the Southeast. Florida remained a Spanish colony and the bulk of the Indian trade moved through British merchant houses perched at the Spanish mouths of Southern rivers. But the United States conducted its own business with the Creeks and national strategists such as Albert Gallatin believed maintaining the old east-west route was crucial to link the Atlantic coast to the Mississippi Valley. (Hudson 2010, 7; Meinig 1986, 313-315) Although mostly restricted to official business, US agents, traders, and armies still used the old trade corridor.</p>
<p>This perhaps explains why the path could still be seen underneath Sturges’s colorful markers of American progress. Amid a tangle of roads in the eastern half of the state, a route still snaked along the southern edge of the Georgia Piedmont southwest to Warrenton, Sparta, and Milledgeville and from there on across Creek territory to the area just south of the Cowetas. It was just one among many routes but a close comparison of Sturges’s map with the Stuart-Purcell map reveals that the old path was still there and also reveals an interesting phenomenon in place names along the old route that helps the modern viewer make out the old trading path.</p>
<p>On the Stuart-Purcell map, the names of intersecting creeks were carefully labeled along the trading path. Leaving Augusta, travelers crossed Butler’s Creek, Boggy Gut, and Sweetwater Creek before skirting the headwaters of Rocky Comfort Creek, (where Warrenton appeared on Sturges’s map). The path then crossed Buffalo Creek (where Sparta lay) and headed for the falls of the Oconee River (site of Milledgeville). The path then skirted the headwaters of Commissioner’s Creek, crossed Oakhanlooga Creek, the Ocmulgee River, Rocky Creek, and the Little Tobasaughki River. Following the most direct roads on Sturges’s map from Augusta to Milledgeville to Fort Hawkins on the Ocmulgee River, the reader sees all of these places names in order and in the same relation to the path as on Stuart-Purcell. Despite Georgia’s rapid re-settlement of former Indian lands, these older place names survived, no doubt because settlement of these regions began while the Indian trade was still going on, meaning that traders and settlers occupied the same space and used the same routes. Thus the old trading path became absorbed into local memory and knowledge that would prove crucial for later researchers.</p>
<p>West of Fort Hawkins, however, the maps diverge in their place names. None of the names found on the Stuart-Purcell map can be found in western Georgia, aside from the major systems such as the Flint and Chattahoochee Rivers. It therefore becomes much more difficult to trace the western half of the trading path across the 1818 map through place names, indicating that its importance as a travel corridor was beginning to fade. But Sturges did quite clearly mark the old trading path as a still-important link between Georgia’s settlements and the Lower Creek villages but in a way that separated it from its Indian past and linked it to Georgia’s political dominance.</p>
<p>Sturges made a careful and clear delineation between Georgia roads and Indian paths. A broad double line linked Milledgeville to Hawkins’s Indian Agency and Fort Mitchell on the Chattahoochee River. As this road crossed Cherokee territory, however, Sturges showed smaller, single-line paths branching off from the main route and running to the old destinations of Coweta, and gave them names such as “Old Sandhill Path.” Some of these paths no doubt represent branches of the main trading route and were a way to contrast the old with the new. Sturges’s map linked European outposts with the same type of roads that crisscrossed the eastern counties of Georgia, asserting their ties to European settlement and forecasting a future occupation and colonization of Creek lands from the east.</p>
<p>As the eastern part of the map became a cartography of settlement, the western remained a cartography of movement. It is unclear how much surveying Georgians had done since the Revolution, but the western reaches of Sturges’s Georgia still seemed marked by maps of movement rather than survey. Closer inspection of the “roads” and paths running through Creek lands reveal that travelers’ reports likely guided Sturges as much as any formal survey. In an unusual feature, the small rivers and creeks that cross these single-line paths all are drawn as running perpendicular to the pathway. As an example, look at the hydrography immediately east of Coweta on the Chattahoochee River. An unnatural pattern of right-angle river junctions indicates that these small streams were recorded as points along a pathway rather than surveyed along their natural courses. A similar pattern follows the single-line paths running along the western bank of the Chattahoochee north to the Cherokees. Similar to other maps of movement from the eighteenth century, these “path maps” indicate that Sturges’s main source of information for these parts of Georgia were verbal travel accounts (likely Euro-American and Native American alike) rather than formal survey. These roughly sketched rivers stood in contrast to Sturges’s detailed instructions to his surveyors to record the courses of rivers within their county surveys. (Cadle 1991, 183, 185)</p>

<h3>Erasing the Paths in the National Atlas</h3>
<p>Although still visible in 1818, the route was fading fast, at least cartographically. Four years after Sturges published his map, a national atlas revealed how the old trade geography could easily be removed from the landscape. <a href="/lines-that-fracture/1822-state-of-georgia#top">The Georgia map in Carey and Lea’s 1822 American Atlas</a> clearly owed much to Sturges but removed much of the finer detail of the earlier map. At the center of the sheet was a map that very closely matched Sturges’s, but reduced in size. The reduction left little room for faint paths or Indian villages. Creek and Cherokee territories were still prominently labeled, but the only feature of the old geography brought over from Sturges was the main road running from Milledgeville to Fort Mitchell. By reducing the original to these particular highlights, the atlas’s engravers also magnified the boosterish elements of Sturges while largely erasing the signifiers of human (and especially indigenous) movement from the face of Georgia.</p>
<p>As if to make the point patently clear, the atlas also surrounded the map with text designed to further emphasize Indians as a vanishing presence in the United States. The description of “Indian Country” (located in the lower, right-hand center of the page) was nothing more than a history of Creek and Cherokee land cessions to the United States, with the implication that the remaining squares would soon be US property as well. The “Historical Sketch” on the map’s right gave Creeks a prominent role in James Oglethorpe’s early military campaigns in Georgia, but reduced them as a group to invaders and capitulators by the end. The Indian trade, so much a part of Georgia’s history during the 1700s, earned no mention at all. Through the reduction in visual space and the increase in text, the atlas makers could easily blur the historical trade route and renarrate it as the leading edge of United States territorial aggrandizement.</p>
<p>In service of this narrative of Creek surrender, Carey and Lea’s map updates Sturges’s old map with a few key features, chief among them their placement of Benjamin Hawkins’s Creek Agency along the route to Columbus. The Agency, first established in the 1790s, would remain the main connection between the United States and the Creeks until the 1820s. Even after the Agency was turned over to settlers, this landmark would remain on Georgia maps even after the agency itself ceased to exist, indicating that the old route was beginning to be part of Georgians’ historical memory.</p>

<h3>Marking the Old Path in the Age of Steam and Rail</h3>
<p>By the 1830s, the geography of the Southeast had transformed and the routes of travel had changed with it. The biggest shifts in the years after Sturges’s map were the addition of Florida to United States territory and the subtraction of most Native Americans through the policy of forced removal in the 1830s. No longer alienated from the Gulf Coast, the growing cotton districts began encroaching on former Creek lands and taking full advantage of the Southeast’s broad river valleys. The 1820s were also the dawn of the steamboat era and rivers, not roads, became the major route to the Southeastern interior, as boats steamed up from ports such as Pensacola and Mobile. (Meinig 1986, 316-323)</p>
<p>The Newberry Library holds <a href="/lines-that-fracture/1835-north-carolina-south#top">a single, user-marked copy of one of Samuel Mitchell’s popular travel maps</a> that reveals how, even after decades of geographic shifts, transportation corridors gradually faded rather that abruptly disappeared. This small map of the Southeast offers an amazing glimpse of how travel through Georgia was transformed in the age of steam and stage while retaining an echo of the older travel routes. Steamboat lines, stagecoach routes, and other roads criss-cross the fragmented surfaces of Georgia and the Carolinas’ colorful counties. Small schedules adorn the map’s margins and offer the traveler the chance to travel anywhere through the Southeast with no clear hierarchy of places aside from the central nodes where steamboat lines and stagecoach routes crossed paths. What is most striking is the potential chaos within these travel choices. The traveler at all times risked getting lost among the possibilities, a continuity with eighteenth-century travelers who feared stepping off the well-worn paths.</p>
<p>However, the older trade corridor still served some purpose. For reasons unknown, one of this map’s former users made a journey across Georgia from Augusta to Columbus, closely following the route of eighteenth-century packhorse trains. Traveling from Virginia, this unknown user may have been rushing to the Alabama lands opening up in the wake of Creek removal or to offer some supplementary service to the rising planters of the region. The central route still seemed to be his most direct path, as numerous stagecoach lines linked Augusta to Milledgeville to Macon (near Hawkins’s old Creek Agency) and onward to Columbus. He would have had to change stage lines numerous times, but the links between these fall-line market towns still allowed a journey along the old corridor. It might be impossible to know whether any of these roads followed the exact route of the Great Old Path, but certainly this traveler was never more than a few miles from the older route even if it was hidden within a web of stage roads, river routes, and burgeoning Main Streets. However, it is only this traveler’s heavy inked line that connects the old locations. Otherwise, the route would fade into the complex network of local roads and rivers that covered the entire map face.</p>

<h3>The Old Path Sidelined in the Age of Rail</h3>
<p>Two maps from the 1860s indicate that cross-state trips across Georgia were increasingly taking different paths. The railroads that remade Georgia’s human geography help do more than obscure the old path among new routes. They actively rerouted human movement along different corridors. As can be seen on <a href="/lines-that-fracture/1869-georgia-central-railroad#top">an 1869 railroad map of Georgia</a>, the railways tended to follow their own logic and reorganized the corridors of travel in the state. Most striking, of course, is the orientation towards the site of Atlanta, founded in 1836 specifically as a railroad junction between Savannah and the West. Older market centers such as Augusta, Macon, and Columbus, still feature prominently on the map, linked by numerous heavy black lines showing Georgia’s major railroads.</p>
<p>But the complex logic of rail companies and the adaptability of rail lines to a wide variety of local terrains meant these routes could, and did, go almost anywhere. Railroads were formed out of a complex mixture of physical geography, local and state political control, and private economic ambition spread over decades. Railroad building in Georgia began in earnest in the 1830s, inspired by South Carolina’s success in establishing a rail line in the state’s upcountry that would help funnel cotton bales to the old port of Charleston, whose light had dimmed somewhat in the federal period. Georgia interests, however, preferred that their state’s lines would work to their benefit and so the merchant classes of Savannah and Augusta carved the state rails into two systems, one terminating at Augusta (the Georgia Western) and another terminating at Savannah (the Georgia Central). But early railroad builders tended to avoid river crossings when possible, as bridges were expensive and difficult to build. Thus railroads tended to follow river valleys and actually reinforced older steamboat routes. (Musich 2006, 118-120, 124) These tendencies revealed themselves in the routes that developed across Georgia in the decades just before the Civil War.</p>
<p>Railroad maps more often reflected company ambitions than reality, but the consistency of railroad routes mapped in Georgia indicates that these lines did serve as the basis for actual rail construction in the state. They therefore became the primary travel corridors through the region, as railroads increasingly became the main way to get across Georgia. In fact, Georgia’s rail line mostly served as mail and travel routes, since most cotton production areas could still more easily and more affordably take advantage of the Southeast’s numerous improved and steam-driven water transportation routes (Meinig 1986, 324-331).</p>
<p>What few travelers there were moved by rail, and they increasingly moved along the railroad companies’ corridors, abandoning the old Piedmont routes. Perhaps the most famous southern traveler in the 1800s, Frederick Law Olmsted crossed Georgia by rail, taking the overland route from Savannah to Columbus by way of Macon. Olmsted, not overly charitable to the South in most of his writing, was at least pleased with the Georgia Central, noting that they were slow but punctual. (He attributed this to the fact that the Georgia Central was mostly run by northerners). He did not dwell on it, but Olmsted did note the fragmentary nature of Georgia’s routes in his brief description of his cross-state travel: “Partly by rail and partly by rapid stage-coaching (the coaches, horses, and drivers again from the North), I crossed the State in about twenty-four hours.” (Olmsted 1953, 212-213) Olmsted’s journey reflected the new routes of travel in the South—stage coaches and railroads centered on river systems were the ways to go.</p>
<p>While travelers such as Olmsted may very well have still used the stage routes and roads of western Georgia, the Appleton map makes the older Macon-Columbus corridor seem like a vanishing presence. No rail lines directly connected Macon to Columbus, and neither Fort Mitchell nor the older site of Coweta was reachable by rail. If anyone had hoped to leave the cotton districts of Augusta and head out for the similar cotton districts of eastern Alabama, they would have been unable to follow the old Augusta-Milledgeville-Macon-Columbus path along the Piedmont. Leaving from Augusta, the traveler would have either had to choose a northern path through Atlanta and then south to eastern Alabama before backtracking to Columbus or taken a spur line south to catch a Georgia Central line through Macon (which involved a southerly detour from Macon before turning westward for Columbus).</p>

<h3>Rail, the Local Road, and the Vanishing Old Path</h3>
<p>A detailed military map of western Georgia revealed what happened to old roads that lay outside the new transportation corridors. By the Civil War, the old path was fading into a series of local routes and thus vanishing from the state and national systems of transport that were growing up alongside the railroad. <a href="/lines-that-fracture/1863-usarmy-map-of-northwest-georgia#top">This 1863 Army Corps of Engineers map of Georgia</a> (part of a set held by the Newberry) provides possibly one of the most detailed views of western Georgia available from the nineteenth century. Titled “Northwestern Georgia” the map offers a much larger scale picture of Georgia’s stage routes and travel corridors thirty years after Samuel Mitchell’s map.</p>
<p>Given the map’s likely purpose for helping to plan Union troop movements through the state, railroads and travel corridors (including stage routes) are obviously highlighted. The map also highlights fortifications and river routes. This was a map designed to help a large number of people move through an unfamiliar territory. It thus offers the modern reader a glimpse of the most commonly used pathways carved into Georgia by the movements of prewar travelers.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the map offers only a few hints at the Great Old Path. What is remarkable is that it does offer some hints at all. Stage routes still wound along the same travel corridors that the old trading path did. While the connections to the Stuart-Purcell map were definitely fainter, they did still exist. Just west of the Ocmulgee River (site of Macon), the map marked a stage road headed towards Columbus with a heavy black line. This route crosses a handful of creeks whose place names indicate it lay near the older trade path. This stage road crossed Rocky Creek and “Tobesofkee” Creek, as did the path on Stuart-Purcell. It then crossed a branch of the Flint River named Sweet Water Creek and a Beaver Creek (an echo perhaps of the “Beaver Dam” Creek on Stuart-Purcell). Most significantly, the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) map shows this route passing nearby the “Old Agency” on the Flint River, a clear reference to Hawkins’s old agency, which had fallen into disuse but remained, for some reason, a landmark in Civil War Georgia.</p>
<p>The map, though, also shows how the old path began to vanish in its western reaches. Columbus, Georgia, had become the new terminus. Located about fifteen miles above the older site of Fort Mitchell, Columbus received the stage lines. Fort Mitchell, still present on this map, received smaller secondary roads branching off of the main stage line, running near the Georgia town of “Cusseta.” These smaller local roads reached Georgia towns but did not in any way provide a clear path through the region. Their function was clearly for local travel, connecting farms and plantations to local markets and towns. This localism of Georgia roadways, however, would change in the 1900s.</p>

<h3>Looking for a Good Road in Georgia</h3>
<p>The roads did not vanish, of course, but the eighty-year rise of the railroad increasingly de-linked the roads of Georgia from any state or national system. Localism prevailed in road funding and maintenance throughout the nineteenth century and affected travel in those areas not touched by southern rails. However, as motoring and automobile advocates increasingly encouraged the development of good roads, America’s cartographic attention turned towards local systems of the nineteenth century. (Akerman 2006, 174-176)</p>
<p>Georgia increasingly needed good roads for its new tourism industry. Following the economic ruin of the Civil War and the collapse of the cotton economy, Southerners found tourism to be a new and attractive industry. Northerners seeking warmer weather began making coastal South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida destination spots by the 1880s. (Weiss 2004, 304-305) This trend only accelerated as the automobile opened southern travel for the middle class and Midwesterners alike. Georgians seeking to draw in Yankee dollars sought to capitalize on the state’s history as a Civil War battlefield (thanks in part to the campaigns planned on maps like the Army Corps of Engineers’), directing motorists along marked heritage trails such as the “Battlefield Route” in the first two decades of the 1900s. The extensive highway development of the “Dixie Road” linking Chicago to Florida along marked state and county routes pushed this intra-state competition further. Revealing the shifts in Georgia’s economy, steam-and-rail transportation hubs such as Rome increasingly lost traffic to history-rich sites like Dalton as heritage-seeking drivers followed the signs to past troop movements. (Ingram 2014, 58-74)</p>
<p><a href="/lines-that-fracture/1919-national-highways-proposed-in-georgia#top">This 1919 map of Georgia produced by the National Highways Association (NHA)</a> revealed the condition of the state’s roads after eighty years of railroad building. While railroad companies emphasized their corridors, daily travel along Georgia’s roads continued. At the dawn of the automobile age, the NHA map sought to organize the local roads of Georgia into some kind of comprehensive system. Travelers accustomed to railroads clearly expected smooth and reliable transportation and the map had to convince motorists that the roadways of Georgia were navigable while at the same time acknowledging that they had not much changed since the dirt tracks of the colonial period.</p>
<p>A study of the map reveals that very few of Georgia’s roads were paved by 1919 and the Piedmont corridor was mostly a series of linked dirt roads connecting small towns. One can perhaps glimpse vestiges of the old stage routes shown on the 1835 Mitchell map. But the 1919 map makes clear just how local roadways had become by the early twentieth century. Along a proposed highway route from Augusta to Macon to Columbus, a traveler would have had to navigate through a number of small towns to pick their way across the state. Rather than stage routes to Milledgeville, Macon, and Columbus, the traveler would have to wind their way through Whitewater, Pinelevel, Knoxville, Roberta, and a dozen other towns just to get from Macon to Columbus.</p>
<p>The map’s makers also acknowledged the localism of Georgia roadways in the legend just below the map’s title. In advocating better systems of roads, the NHA map called attention to a feature (and inconvenience) of early twentieth-century motoring: the need to privilege local information over professional maps. Making clear to its audience that 99.5% of the mapped roads were in existence (rather than merely proposed), the map nonetheless encouraged its users to stop and ask directions from locals, acknowledging that “Sometimes… political or local influence has built a better adjacent road. Inquiry by the tourist en route will produce the needed local information.” And, given that the roads were for the most part unpaved, the map again encouraged tourists to “make careful inquiry for road conditions” after a heavy rain, self-promotionally reminding readers that “only a Hard Road is a good road 365 days in the year.” This was similar to the grudging encouragement motoring advocates gave would-be tourists to stop and consult the locals for the best routes through an area. (Akerman 2006, 168-169) A century and a half after Stuart-Purcell, human information was still crucial to travel, although the experts in local geography were now much more likely to be African American than Native American.</p>
<p>While the National Highways map evinces a slight frustration at the localism of road travel through Georgia, it also hints at a transformation in travel through the state. The localism of Georgia and the sense of a vanishing past were becoming destinations in and of themselves. As travel in the state shifted from railways to roadways, the desire to connect with a lost Georgia was becoming tied to the effort of moving through these small towns and along these dusty and/or muddy local roads. As Americans jumped into their ever-increasing fleet of cars, the new technology of transport (and the local boosters of Georgia’s towns and counties) encouraged heritage tourism along historical travel routes, tying automobile travel to a growing sense of US national identity. (Akerman 2006, 195, 198-203) This push onto the backroads encouraged the development of state and national highway systems and brought the pavers to America’s local roadways.</p>
<p>Georgia’s attachment to snowbird tourism reoriented the main corridors of travel yet again. While every local route slowly became absorbed into state and regional systems, distinct patterns of traffic began to appear on Georgia’s road maps in the years after 1930. Increasingly, people moved through Georgia from north to south, following roads from the Midwest and Northeast, mostly on their way to the growing tourist playground of Florida. As a dramatic example, strip maps began highlighting north-south routes through Georgia, cutting the eastern and western edges of the state off completely (map reprinted in Akerman 2006, 157).</p>

<h3>North, South, and Motoring through Georgia</h3>
<p>Even on those maps promoting Georgia as a destination, the north-south orientation of the twentieth-century traveler becomes clear. Over a decade after the National Highways Association map of Georgia, <a href="/lines-that-fracture/1930-motor-routes-to-augusta#top">an Automobile Association of America map</a> reveals the growing links between road travel and an effort to recapture the past and the northern orientation of the targeted audience. Although routes had been given numbers in the federal highway system, the fragmentation and localism of the roads persisted from the National Highways map. In particular, this map reveals that Georgia’s roads had not improved all that much between 1919 and 1930, so the local knowledge of condition and direction likely persisted for anyone trying to make their way through Georgia. But the maps are increasingly seeking to bypass this localism in favor of carrying travelers directly and safely to a few chosen destination spots.</p>
<p>This map, designed to highlight Augusta as a tourist destination, organizes the roadways of the eastern United States in such a way as to make a trip to Augusta seem like the most natural decision in the world. The map helpfully makes Augusta its main focus by writing the town name in heavy orange letters amid the generally blue background of the rest of America. United States highway routes are similarly highlighted in orange ink, showing a system of orange roads leading to the major population centers of the northeast and midwest. Indeed, the orange routes resemble a new kind of river system, all converging on the destination of Augusta. Rather than the point of departure it had been in the days of the Indian trade, Augusta was trying to become the point of arrival.</p>
<p>The map highlights the older cross-state travel route as part of a planned system of improved highways connecting Augusta to Montgomery, Alabama, but other maps from later in the century indicate that this never became a major thoroughfare. Look to the modern highway map of Georgia and one can see that all roads first pass through the hub of Atlanta and that the old cross-state journey along the fall line would require careful planning along some combination of state and US routes, with few interstate highways heading in one’s direction.</p>

<h3>New Routes in the Age of Electrification</h3>
<p>As gasoline power transformed Georgia’s transportation routes from east-west to north-south, the twentieth century’s other great energy form rushed into the old spaces. Electric companies needed a different set of routes than automobiles and tourists. The twentieth-century power industry favored broad regional networks of production and consumption sites. Given that electricity moved at the speed of light, distance did not matter so much as connectivity: The ability to draw on sources of hydroelectric and coal-burning generators and connect them to multiple population centers. The business favored those companies that could marshal the immense capital necessary to create a grid capable of matching consistent supply with consistent demand. (Hughes 1983, 363-403; Durden 2001, 3-29) Likely due to the twin needs for cheap rights-of-way and to link nonagricultural resource centers, the long-distance transmission lines tended to go where the people were not. Population centers would be connected to these out-of-the-way trunk lines through smaller substations and local transmission grids.</p>
<p>The old Augusta-Columbus corridor become a new center of travel thanks to these changes. <a href="/lines-that-fracture/1968-principal-us-electric#top">A 1967 map the Rand McNally Company published on behalf of the Edison Electric Commission</a> demonstrates how the old abandoned travel route took on new significance as power shifted from human to electric. Because of Rand McNally’s involvement, it is perhaps unsurprising that it at first glance looks like a national road map. However, the map depicts the nation’s major power lines, linking together the numerous regional systems into a national whole (not so different from the railroad and highway maps of an earlier age).</p>
<p>In Georgia, the lines trace a path that is at once familiar and alien. Bright red lines indicating an electrical carrying capacity of 230 kilovolts cross the state from Augusta to Columbus, occupying the old trade corridor nearly perfectly. What was new, however, was the geography along the way. The map largely ignores towns and makes note of transfer stations who do not share the names of nearby towns. The lines avoid the population centers of Georgia, for perhaps obvious reasons (no one wants high-tension wires running through their yard). Their placement along the older east-west corridor suggests that this route, visible on road maps of the twentieth century, was not a major thoroughfare in modern Georgia.</p>

<h3>Searching for the Great Old Path in the Twentieth Century</h3>
<p>Created by automobiles and electrical grids, this new Piedmont began to strike some as “natural.” As Georgia continued to seek tourism dollars and tourists continued to seek American “wilderness,” the former path of horses and humans attracted efforts to map the vanished colonial route. The distance between the eighteenth century and the twentieth became clear when preservationists and memorialists tried to recreate the travels of William Bartram, the eighteenth-century naturalist who traveled the Georgia trading paths and whose published travel accounts of the flora and fauna along Georgia’s trading paths were a landmark in early American writing. As the United States approached its bicentennial in 1976, Americans had enjoyed over five decades of automobile tourism and its attendant association with the continent’s past travelers. Highway markers, historic travel tourism, and living history tourism centers had all taught citizens that to be American was to move through space. Moreover, the rapidly modernizing and electrifying New South gave the region’s visitors a sense that some part of the nation’s past was rapidly vanishing. In response, researchers in the period after the Second World War attempted to retrace the Indian traders’ eighteenth-century steps.</p>
<p>One of the most ambitious and remarkable episodes in southeastern travel tourism came when a Cornell zoologist named Francis Harper attempted to recreate Bartram’s travels. Harper had developed an interest in Bartram and, in 1940, spent a year traveling throughout the South in an effort to record the same species of plants and animals Bartram had and to survey what remained of the landscape Bartram had traveled. As he put it, he sought “the relocation of many choice spots that these pioneers had visited and described.” (Harper 1958, vi) Believing that many parts of the natural and Indian landscape had “suffered from the ravages of road builders,” Harper scoured all available evidence to locate the routes Bartram took as he crisscrossed the Southeast in the 1770s. Like any good motor tourist, Harper asked locals for directions, recording their input into what routes he should take and combined these with early and contemporary maps to create a carefully annotated edition of Batram’s Travels, published in 1958. (Cappon 1974, 511)</p>
<p>But Harper discovered an important lesson about tracing historic routes: it is amazingly difficult. The local decisions about roads and routes, changing constantly and almost entirely out of sight of the official record, made such a task nearly impossible. As Harper himself had to acknowledge, after years of research, the best he could do was approximate Bartram’s travels, an impressive enough accomplishment. “Here and there, the trail remains obscure,” he wrote, “and yet over literally hundreds of miles the present-day follower of Bartram need not deviate more than a few feet (or rods at most) from his time-worn track.” (Cappon 1974, 511)</p>
<p>The frustration of trying to excavate a route from beneath layers of subsequent patterns of movement could wear at even the most experienced researchers. When the Newberry Library participated in the research and creation of <a href="/lines-that-fracture/1976-mapping-the-travels-of-john#top">the 1976 <em>Atlas of Early American History</em></a>, the volume’s editors hoped to include a map of Bartram’s travels as a way of demonstrating Enlightenment science in a cartographic manner. (Cappon 1974, 508) The task must have seemed simple at first: Plot the places that William and his father John mentioned on their various journeys onto a modern map of North America so that the viewer could literally “see” the expansion of science and knowledge across the face of the continent.</p>
<p>But even a path as seemingly well documented as Bartram’s proved almost impossible to recover. As the president of the Bartram Trails Society in Georgia related to the Newberry researchers behind the Atlas:</p>
<p>“Mrs. Ruth Shockley is working on the Trail from Macon, Ga. west to the Alabama line in Fort Benning, Ga. Some of this is easy to locate as the old indian trail along the fall line of Georgia became a dirt road and later a lot of the original trail was paved - about thirty five miles of the trail from Camac, Ga. to Sparta, Ga., was used to build a railroad that is still in use. Mrs. Shockley is having trouble locating the trail through Taylor county because there is no road or trace of an original road that crossed that county. Taylor county is sand hill country. We expect to get copies of the original land lot surveys of that county hoping that the original surveyors made some note of the indian trail or of the Old Federal Roade [sic] that was made of this indian trail.” (Bell 1971, 1)</p>
<p>After almost two hundred years of route revision, the original trading path had faded and local surveys were the best hope for finding the actual path. To record the succession of the route, Shockley would have needed consistent surveys from all of Taylor County’s history—a daunting prospect. Even in 2014, Shockley’s successors in the Georgia Bartram Trails Society have to recognize that, while the historic paths can be approximated, they cannot be completely duplicated; they are “an attempt to furnish a similar wilderness experience in the general area he traveled.” (Georgia Bartram Trail Group, 2014)</p>
<p>The task almost defeated the Newberry’s researchers for the reasons already touched on in this essay: Place names from the eighteenth century rarely matched with later maps; eighteenth-century travelers did not record their journeys with planimetric precision; and the travelers’ sense of space was not the same as a mapmaker’s. In the Newberry’s archive of material related to the Atlas’s creation, one must empathize with the frustrated researcher who, working only from the historic record, could not reconcile the gaps and contradictions of Bartram’s own record of his trip. In the end, she was left wondering whether it was time “to stop throwing good money after bad on the Bartrams’ travel maps… If I had known two years ago what I know now about the source materials for this topic, I would have argued strenuously that this page of maps was not worth its cost in general utility for the historian.” (Petchenik, 1) In the end, the Society pointed to Harper’s work as the best source available and so the Newberry mostly plotted his somewhat rough maps onto a modern map of North America. The map included all river courses but was otherwise blank except for key cities and places Bartram visited. For the route across Georgia, the best anyone could do was trace the fall line and call it a day. Two centuries of human movement had blurred the original location of the trading paths and no historic map could have faithfully plotted the trail to the degree necessary to walk the actual route.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>The Atlas’s researchers revealed both a persistent wish and a stubborn reality. The urge to travel the same ground as past actors was and is a powerful one; we have the overwhelming evidence of battlefields, house museums, and other sites of memory as proof. But when it comes to actually traveling the same routes that those past actors took, one has to reckon with the fact that corridors of travel simply do not preserve as well as buildings or broad swaths of topography. Seemingly permanent and rigid, these networks of paths, roads, and rails jumped and arced across the landscape as humans shifted their means of living and their personal desires. They did so too slowly for individual travelers or even individual mapmakers to capture but their shifts but the changing geography of movement emerges across centuries of mapmaking.</p>
<p>But, tantalizing as those maps are, they also reveal their limits regarding human movement. The human creators of these maps, inserting their own elisions and abstractions into the proceedings, can only convey a general sense of direction across the landscape. They cannot pinpoint precise locations. Careful comparison between regional and local maps, combined with the powerful geo-correcting tools of modern mapping software might provide a best guess, but the truth is maps will remain impressionistic.</p>
<p>Impressionistic should not be mistaken for trivial, however. As a broad survey of Georgia maps reveals, human movements are a sensitive indicator of broad economic and cultural shifts. The thin webs of connection that linked peoples and landscapes together changed and responded to both distant and local developments. While we might not be able to walk in our predecessors’ actual footsteps, we can still reveal much about how those footsteps took shape and, more importantly, how those footsteps in turn shaped the world.</p>

<h3>Further Reading</h3>
<p>A warning to researchers: Attempts to carefully trace out the succession of roadways and paths in the United States will meet with two big issues concerning this nation’s history: The persistent localism of most overland routes and the lack of consistent local mapping of those routes. For all of the eighteenth and most of the nineteenth century, roads were a local concern placed under the jurisdiction of local and county governments. But most of the mapping, either state-sponsored or privately created, was at the state, regional, or continental scale. The abstraction necessary for completing such maps, combined with inconsistent surveys conducted at the local level, means that one would have a difficult time finding maps that accurately place the roads through any given region. These mapped routes might connect the same places over time, but their courses would vary. And without a strong set of local maps, the modern researcher would be hard-pressed to identify which cartographic alterations were the result of actual changes in the route and which were simply the result of different mapmakers’ generalizations.</p>
<p>But for those interested in route succession, there is a burgeoning field of transportation studies to provide the proverbial “road map” in the field. The literature on railroads is, of course, extensive and beyond the scope of this one paragraph (and is covered quite well in other essays in this collection). However, for those interested in roads and travel, I highly recommend beginning with D.W. Meinig’s <em>The Shaping of America</em> series. A multivolume text that covers a broad stretch of time and territory in the Americas, it is an invaluable resource for those interested in historical geography, American routes, or how space shaped the history of North America. For recent scholar approaches, the essays in the <em>Cartographies of Travel and Navigation</em> volume (edited by James Akerman) are invaluable. And for those who really love southern roads, two recent excellent books stand out: Angela Pulley <em>Hudson’s Creek Paths and Federal Roads</em> demonstrates how important roads were in Indian-white relations and Tammy Ingram’s <em>Dixie Highway</em> captures the transformation of the New South as dirt roads became paved.</p>

  return `<p>Human beings have always communicated—our ancestors communicated before they were technically human beings—yet the concept of “communication,” as we understand it today, is remarkably recent in origin. It was only in the nineteenth century that the word communication came to refer primarily to the transfer of information. Before that, the word was used to describe any kind of physical exchange: commerce, gift-giving, even sexual intercourse. A door offered communication from one room to another. Scientists spoke of the communication of momentum or heat. Our modern understanding of communication has been powerfully shaped by technological change. In particular, nineteenth-century technologies like the telegraph and telephone demanded a word for the new thing they did—transmitting information without physical transportation—and an old term was refitted for this purpose. Communication, in this newer sense, became and still is a defining preoccupation of our age (Peters 1999, 3-10).</p>
<p>Mapping communication is also a modern preoccupation. In a way, any map used for travel or navigation could also be considered a map of communication. But in order to draw a map of communication qua communication, one must believe that at least two places on that map want to communicate with each other, and one must conceive of their communication as a thing to be mapped. This means that maps of communication can be rich historical sources, not only for evidence about specific communication routes and practices, but also about the various networks and communities of which people imagined themselves a part. If we agree with Benedict Anderson (1983) that nations are “imagined communities,” and that maps have been powerful tools for constructing the modern nation, then maps of communication are doubly so. Both the nation and the network must be imagined to be mapped, and mapped to be imagined.</p>
<p>Geography, technology, and politics made communication networks particularly visible and mappable to Americans in the late eighteenth, nineteenth, and early twentieth centuries—the same years, of course, in which the United States itself was constructed. By studying maps of communication in the US, we can see a nation imagining itself, and we can chart some of the changing horizons of American life. At what geographic scale did Americans imagine their own identities? What networks did they see themselves as part of? Maps of communication can provide a window on these questions.</p>
<p>In reading historical maps, we must remember that mapping is always prescriptive as well as descriptive. Maps of communication show us who communicated with whom, but they also train us to imagine such communication. Many of the maps examined in this essay are official or semiofficial maps: “Top-down” tools of government or private industry. We should read them, at least in part, as prescriptive maps of sanctioned communication. Part of their work was to tell Americans with whom they should communicate, or to illustrate the communities of which they should imagine themselves a part. Maps of communication served in part to paper over fissures, tensions, and divides. It takes close reading and attention to historical context to remember that there were alternate networks and alternate geographies not shown on these maps.</p>

<h3>Colonial Communications</h3>
<p>In the early eighteenth century, few could have predicted that Britain’s American colonies would soon be the site of two revolutions: A political revolution, but also a communications revolution that would turn a peripheral string of coastal settlements into the loudest, fastest, most prodigious nation of communicators in the world. Long distance communication in British North America was difficult and slow. Printed materials were scarce, the postal system was expensive, and the small population was thinly spread over hundreds of miles of rough terrain. Most adults could read and write, thanks to common schools and widespread belief in the importance of studying scripture for salvation, but colonial communication networks were highly stratified.</p>
<p>The communication network that mattered most to colonial elites was not trans-American but transatlantic. Wealthy colonists looked back across the ocean to Britain and Europe for information, culture, and identity. They took part in a transatlantic exchange of letters, books, and periodicals to which the great majority of Americans had little access (Brown 2000). One great exemplar of the transatlantic communications network, and one of the first people to map it, was Benjamin Franklin. Printer by trade and scientist by avocation, Franklin kept up a steady correspondence with scholars and statesmen in England, Scotland, and France. In 1737, Franklin became the postmaster for Philadelphia. In 1753, he went to London to serve as deputy postmaster for all of Britain’s North American colonies. Franklin’s famous chart of the Gulf Stream (<a href="/mapping-communication/1768-chart-gulf-stream#top">Map #1</a>), published in 1769, was in fact a map of transatlantic communications. As postmaster, Franklin wondered why British mail ships took longer to sail from Europe to America than those returning from America to Europe. He consulted with merchant and whaling captains and realized the westbound ships were fighting against a current. Sailors had certainly noticed the wide band of warmer water flowing up the coast of North America and east across the Atlantic, but it was Franklin who named the Gulf Stream and mapped it in its totality, and it was the regular flow of letters back and forth across the Atlantic that made it visible and mappable to him (Johnson 2008, 9-11).</p>
<p>As tension between Britain and the colonies grew, communication itself became highly politicized. The Stamp Act of 1765 placed a heavy tax on newspapers and periodicals, turning many printers and publishers against the British government. Popular pamphlets like Thomas Paine’s <em>Common Sense</em> mobilized a broad public, enlarging and radicalizing the circuits of communication (Starr 2004, 47-82). Yet while the press fomented rebellion, the post remained an instrument of the crown. In 1773, the British postmaster general instructed Hugh Finlay, Franklin’s successor as colonial postmaster, to travel through the colonies mapping and assessing the postal system. Finlay’s maps (<a href="/mapping-communication/1773-colonial-post-roads#top">Map #2</a>) and journals offer a valuable portrait of both communications and political unrest on the eve of the American Revolution. Everywhere he went, Finlay found colonists and even postal employees circumventing the official postal system, sending and carrying letters outside the mail to avoid British postage or surveillance (Steele 1983). So his maps described the official network of communication sanctioned by the crown, while his journals described the thriving counter-networks that were stitching together a new American identity.</p>

<h3>The Revolution after the Revolution</h3>
<p>The American Revolution was followed by a communications revolution. This second revolution would involve steamboats, railroads, and telegraphs, along with advances in printing and publishing, but its origins were cultural and political as much as technological. The role of print and post in the war for independence imbued many Americans with the ideal of a free press and an informed citizenry. The new republic encouraged the spread of schooling and literacy, subsidized newspapers with cheap postage, and constructed the largest, most active postal system in the world. By 1831, the United States had almost twice as many post offices as Great Britain and five times as many as France. These offices employed more than 8,700 postmasters, a larger force than the US Army or indeed any other single enterprise in the country. The postal system was then carrying thirteen million letters and sixteen million newspapers per year, figures that would triple by the end of that decade (John 1995; John 2000). “There is an astonishing circulation of letters and newspapers among these savage woods,” wrote Alexis de Tocqueville in 1831. “I do not think that in the most enlightened rural districts of France there is intellectual movement either so rapid or on such a scale as in this wilderness.”</p>
<p>A famous set of maps from Charles O. Paullin’s <em>Atlas of the Historical Geography of the United States</em> (<a href="/mapping-communication/1932-rivers-roads-rates#top">Map #3</a>) shows the expansion of post roads and canals in the early nineteenth century, and the increasing speed of travel and communication in America. As Paullin’s maps illustrate, travel times in 1830 were approximately half of what they had been in 1800. It still took weeks for news to travel from, for example, New York to New Orleans, but it took two weeks instead of four. Paullin’s contour maps center on New York, but New York in the early 1800s was not the center of American communications in the way it would be by Paullin’s day. In the early nineteenth century, America’s communications infrastructure was polycentric, with distinct regional networks and variations from place to place. Most Southern states, for instance, rejected common schools (for both whites and blacks), had fewer printers and publishers than the North, and, with the support of the federal government, censored the mail in defense of slavery (Brown 1989; Starr 2004, 83-112).</p>
<p>Still, by the 1840s and 1850s, cheap postage and a widely literate population had made the US mail a mass medium, and postal communication truly national. This national network was made most visible—and thus worthy of mapping—during episodes of migration and dislocation like the California Gold Rush or the Civil War, when many Americans traveled far from home and many more tracked their journeys with both maps and correspondence (Henkin 2008). J.H. Colton’s <em>Map of the United States</em> (<a href="/mapping-communication/1849-routes-to-california#top">Map #4</a>), published at the peak of the California Gold Rush in 1849, highlights the long, difficult routes by which gold-seekers traveled to California and then communicated with friends and family back home. The overland journey could take as much as seven months; the sea journey around the southern tip of South America was no faster. Of course, mail carried by men on horseback could travel faster than a wagon train. The most famous example, though it operated for only a few years, was the Pony Express, a private chain of relay stations with riders and fast horses. Established in 1860, the Pony Express astonished the nation by carrying letters from Missouri to California in about ten days. Episodes like the Gold Rush gave many Americans their first opportunity to communicate with someone on the other side of the continent. Transcontinental maps and the experience of transcontinental communication trained Americans to see the West as part of the United States, a single nation stretching from sea to sea.</p>

<h3>The Railroad and the Telegraph</h3>
<p>America’s communications revolution gained even greater speed with the coming of the railroad and the telegraph. Samuel Morse, the son of geographer Jedidiah Morse, introduced his electric telegraph in 1844. Morse hoped to sell his invention to the Post Office, but it declined, leaving development of the telegraph in the US to private firms. The first American railways were constructed in the 1830s, with the real boom in railroad construction coming in the late 1840s and after. Rail and telegraph networks often grew together. The railroads gave telegraph companies the right-of-way to string their wires and the telegraph companies gave the railroads free service to coordinate their trains. By 1848, telegraph lines ran from New York as far south as New Orleans and as far west as Chicago. By 1857, they connected every state east of the Mississippi River (John 2000; Hochfelder 2012).</p>
<p>As the communications scholar James Carey observed, the telegraph severed communication from transportation, making it possible to send information faster than any person, horse, or train (Carey 1989, 203-204). This turned communications into its own distinct activity, and indeed, our modern sense of the word communication, meaning the transmission of information as distinguishable from physical travel or exchange, emerged at exactly this time. At the same time, the telegraph attached communication to a fixed, physical network of poles and wires. These two shifts made it meaningful to draw maps of communication in a way it had not been before.</p>
<p>Rudd and Carlton’s <em>Map of the Submarine Telegraph between America &amp; Europe</em> (<a href="/mapping-communication/1858-wire-across-ocean#top">Map #5</a>) shows the first transatlantic telegraph cable, connecting Valentia Island, Ireland to Trinity Bay, Newfoundland. The cable was the vision of Cyrus Field, a paper manufacturer who, along with Samuel Morse, formed the American Telegraph Company, one of the leading telegraph conglomerations of its day. Stringing a 1,600-mile cable across the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean was no easy feat. Two of the largest navy vessels in the world—one American, one British—met in the middle of the North Atlantic, each carrying thousands of tons of insulated copper wire. They connected their cables, then slowly sailed back to Ireland and Newfoundland, carefully unspooling the cable into the ocean as they went. After multiple failed attempts, the ships carrying each end of the cable reached land in August 1858. North America and Europe were, briefly, joined in electrical communication. This map was published to celebrate and publicize this historic achievement. But transmission on the line proved difficult and slow; it could take hours to send and accurately decipher a single message. After less than a month of operation, the cable failed permanently. Almost a decade passed before a second transatlantic cable was completed in 1866.</p>
<p>E.W. Welton’s <em>Map of the California State Telegraph and Overland Mail Road</em> (<a href="/mapping-communication/1866-wire-across-continent#top">Map #6</a>) shows one portion of the first transcontinental telegraph line, which connected California to the eastern United States in 1861. The telegraph to the Pacific followed the eastern portion of the Oregon Trail as far west as Wyoming, then ran southwest to Salt Lake City and across the desert to Carson City and Sacramento. The line was built and operated by American Telegraph’s great rival, Hiram Sibley’s Western Union, along with a consortium of California firms. Western Union received generous subsidies for this work from the federal government, which saw the transcontinental telegraph as an important way of keeping California attached to the Union, both practically and symbolically, during the Civil War. The telegraph never became a mass medium like the postal service, but it transformed the distribution of news and business information. In 1860, the Pony Express had broken all previous records when it brought news of Abraham Lincoln’s election to the West Coast only one week after the East. In 1865, news of Lincoln’s assassination reached San Francisco by telegraph overnight.</p>
<p>The speed of the telegraph changed the business of news-gathering and indeed the meaning of “news” itself. The Civil War introduced Americans to the experience, then nearly unprecedented, of receiving running accounts of battles as they happened. “You cannot imagine the feeling of knowing there is a battle going on,” wrote Anna Shaw Curtis, the sister of Colonel Robert Shaw, in 1862. “Men cannot think, write, or attend to their ordinary business,” observed Oliver Wendell Holmes. During major battles, newspapers sold five times as many copies as usual. Crowds gathered at telegraph offices to receive updates on events. Mapmaker Louis Prang sold a “War Telegram Marking Map” that came with colored pencils so civilians could mark the advance or retreat of Union and Confederate troops after each telegraphic update from the front (Hochfelder 2012, 91-95).</p>
${validate_component(Image, "Image").$$render($$result, { index: "4" }, {}, {})}
<h3>Mapping Time and Space</h3>
<p>The telegraph even altered the mapping of time and space. For nineteenth-century mapmakers and navigators, time was space: the only precise way to determine the longitude between two points was to compare astronomical measurements made from both points at the same time. In the eighteenth century, navigators used chronometers—reliable clocks—to determine time and therefore longitude. But the nearly instantaneous signals of the telegraph offered far more precision than even the best clocks. In 1848, the Harvard Observatory and the US Coast Survey began working together to determine longitude by telegraph. The astronomers watched the stars and tapped out time signals; the mapmakers used their measurements and signals to determine the precise longitude between any two points on the telegraph line. By 1858, this was known as the “American method” of longitude determination, and had been used to fix the relative location of American ports from New Orleans to Calais, Maine. In 1866, the second transatlantic cable made it possible to measure the exact longitude between North America and Europe—after the surveyors waited seven rainy weeks for a night on which both Valentia, Ireland and Heart’s Content, Newfoundland could see the stars (Galison 2003; Stachurski 2009).</p>
<p>Like everything else in late nineteenth-century America, time was becoming a commodity, something to be bought and sold. By the 1870s, Harvard and other observatories charged for access to their telegraphically-transmitted time signals, selling the exact time to ports, where ship’s captains set their chronometers before voyages, to jewelers, who sold accurate time pieces (what good was an expensive watch, the thinking went, if it did not show the true time?), and above all, to the railroads, which did more than any other industry to standardize measures of time (Galison 2003). Before the late nineteenth century, every community kept track of its own time. But for efficiency and safety, railroads in this era started synchronizing their clocks by telegraph, with each system adopting the local time of the most important city it served. The Pennsylvania Railroad ran on Philadelphia time, the New York Central on New York City time, and so on. As American railroads grew and interconnected, they gradually chased away local times. In 1883, all the major North American railroads agreed to adopt a system of standardized time zones. A map of the system published in 1889 (<a href="/mapping-communication/1899-new-economy">Map #7</a>) shows the time zones much as we know them today, along with a list of conversions back to the old local, or solar, times for each city: Eastern Standard Time is sixteen minutes slower than Boston’s solar time, but eight minutes faster than Washington, DC’s, etc. This multiplicity of local times seems chaotic to us now, but it was not experienced as such before the 1880s. Having a few minutes difference between Boston and New York was only a nuisance after the railroad and telegraph wired these communities together, creating the expectation of simultaneity. Once again, maps of communication were also maps of Americans’ social and commercial horizons, charting the changing scale of American life.</p>

<h3>Mapping the Economy</h3>
<p>In the second half of the nineteenth century, the long lines of the railroad and telegraph became a national grid. By 1871, American railroads had laid approximately 45,000 miles of track, including the first transcontinental railroad, completed in 1869. Over the next thirty years, Americans would build another 170,000 miles of track, including four more transcontinentals and a dense web of interconnections east of the Mississippi: “Railroads as thick as grasshoppers,” in the words of one newspaper (Musich 2006, 124). The furious competition and construction of the 1870s and 1880s was followed by a wave of takeovers and bankruptcies in the 1890s. By the turn of the century, two-thirds of US railroads were operated by one of seven large conglomerates, and Western Union’s monopoly over the long distance telegraph was secure (Chandler 2000, 11-12).</p>
<p>These maps of Ohio and Pennsylvania (<a href="/mapping-communication/1899-new-economy">Map #8</a>), from a railway atlas published by the George F. Cram Company in 1899, show a thicket of interconnected trunk, branch, and short lines. Along with the Rand McNally Company, George Cram pioneered the use of wax engraving, a method of producing maps that was faster and cheaper than traditional copperplate engraving. To many eyes, wax-engraved maps were less aesthetically appealing than copperplate maps, but they could contain far more detail. Cram’s maps were crammed full of tiny place names and other text. His map of Pennsylvania shows 135 different railroads and more than a thousand towns and villages. These were detailed reference works, not works of art (Schulten 2001, 23-28).</p>
<p>The title page of Cram’s railway atlas made its audience and purpose clear. The atlas, the 1887 edition declared, was “prepared to fill the wants of Banks, Bankers, Brokers, [and] Railroad Officials” by showing “locations of Towns, Railroads, giving Population by Towns and Counties, designating Post Money Order and Telegraph Offices, with the number of Banks in each place.” Railroads, telegraphs, and banks—these atlases were maps of the economy, of the lines and wires through which capital and commodities now flowed. The carpet of place names on each map made another powerful point. Every little village and hamlet was now part of the national grid, their significance defined less by topography or terrain than by their proximity to trunk lines and telegraph offices (Short 2001, 221-229).</p>
<p>Not everyone embraced the grid. The railroad and telegraph were supposed to bring prosperity, but they also brought economic dislocation and an unprecedented concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a few rich men. Small businesses were swallowed up; big businesses grew bigger. Some grew so big that many Americans feared they were incompatible with democracy. The late nineteenth century’s favorite caricature of corporate power—the octopus—was a vivid representation of this fear. All those cartoons depicting Western Union, Standard Oil, and the railroads as giant octopuses with their tentacles reaching across the nation were, if not maps per se, anxious visual representations of the new networks of commerce and communication (MacDougall 2014).</p>
<p><em>The Telephone and the Scale of American Life</em></p>
<p>The telephone, invented in America’s centennial year of 1876, would eventually eclipse the telegraph, connecting almost every home and life to the new national grid. In its early years, however, the telephone was less a rival than a complement to the telegraph. Bell Telephone leased telephones and patent rights to operating companies in different regions of the country, creating a patchwork of regional Bell monopolies. The Bell companies in the 1880s and early 1890s concentrated on bringing telephones to big cities and wealthy customers, and often acted as a feeder network for Western Union’s telegraph lines. After the Bell patents expired in 1894, thousands of new telephone systems were established across the country. Bell’s new competitors called themselves the independent telephone movement. Some of these independents competed directly with Bell for its valuable urban markets. Many more brought the telephone to small towns and rural areas that the Bell monopoly had not served. Competition sped construction and drove down the price of telephone service. The number of telephone users in the United States exploded from the thousands to the millions in just a few short years.</p>
<p>The contest between the Bell System and its independent competitors was a kind of referendum on the scale of American economic life. The Bell companies symbolized and promoted national integration through commerce. The American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T), which took control of the Bell System after 1900, staked its success on the long distance telephone, building a nationwide long distance network that the independents never rivaled. In 1915, AT&amp;T celebrated its first coast-to-coast telephone call. The independents questioned the importance of very long distance telephony. Why, they asked, would an ordinary American in Indiana or Ohio ever need to call anyone in San Francisco? They focused instead on short and middle distance communication, connecting towns to the farms and villages in their own hinterlands, and building regional networks that mapped onto the regional subsystems of the American economy. A 1905 map of independent toll lines in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania (<a href="/mapping-communication/1905-independent-telephone#top">Map #9</a>) suggests both the extent and the limits of the independent approach. What the map depicts is not a single, national system centered on New York City—the Bell companies fought hard to protect their largest urban markets, and the independents struggled to gain footholds there. Instead, the map presents a network of smaller networks linking together small and medium-sized towns. When Americans chose between installing an independent telephone or a Bell telephone, they were, in effect, signaling their allegiance to either the older, more regional, economy or an emerging new economy of national markets and corporations.</p>
<p>This contest was waged with maps and images as well as money and wires. The independents produced countless caricatures of AT&amp;T as an octopus or spider, implying that there was something monstrous or unnatural about its continent-spanning wires. But independent competition peaked in the first decade of the twentieth century, and the Bell companies bounced back in the years to come. AT&amp;T advertisements from the 1910s and 1920s vigorously promoted the ideal of a single, national communications network. Many of these ads featured maps of a nation made small by the long-distance telephone, and images of giant businessmen stretching their arms across the continent, a visual answer to the monstrous octopus trope. As much as any other company, AT&amp;T in this era taught Americans to stop worrying and love the grid.</p>
<p><em>Radio and the Decline of the Local</em></p>
<p>A similar contest between local and national visions of communication was waged in the early days of radio. The radio was originally understood as a wireless version of the telephone or telegraph, to be used for two-way point-to-point communication. Guglielmo Marconi introduced a system for wireless telegraphy in 1899 and the first crystal radio sets were constructed around 1906. In the decade that followed, thousands of wireless hobbyists built their own two-way sets and thrilled at throwing their voices across the continent without wires. The United States and other governments began to regulate the radio spectrum after the Titanic disaster in 1912, and the US War Department and Navy Department took control of the technology in America during the First World War. After 1918, the War and Navy Departments sponsored the creation of the Radio Corporation of America (RCA), pooling all the radio patents held by General Electric, Westinghouse, and AT&amp;T. Westinghouse was the first company to realize the commercial potential of one-way broadcasting. An employee and wireless hobbyist named Frank Conrad had started transmitting “concerts” from his Pittsburgh home, playing phonograph records and the piano into a crystal set. Thinking this might boost the sale of radio receivers, Conrad’s bosses gave him a stronger transmitter and a regular gig. From there, commercial radio was born.</p>
<p>Westinghouse’s radio station KDKA made its first broadcast in November 1920. By the middle of the decade, hundreds of stations had been established, and millions of Americans were listening to the radio every day. Rand McNally’s <em>Radio Map of the United States</em> (<a href="/mapping-communication/1926-radio-stations#top">Map #10</a>), published in 1926, captures the industry on the cusp of a transition. Early radio broadcasting was ad hoc, chaotic, and profoundly local in its orientation. It cost relatively little to establish a local radio station. By 1926, dozens of churches, department stores, high schools, labor unions, college fraternities, Tin Pan Alley music publishers, revival preachers, even quack doctors and flat-earthers owned their own radio stations. But in the year this map was published, RCA struck a deal with AT&amp;T to link radio stations across the nation by wire, creating a national radio network, based on a new business model: Professional programming produced for sponsors and paid for with on-air advertising spots. Rural and regional interests fought against the consolidation of radio into national chains, but the financial clout of the networks, the influence of federal regulators, and the mass appeal of commercial programming made the fight to preserve local radio a losing battle.</p>

<h3>Communications Today</h3>
<p>The revolutions in communication that began with popular literacy and an affordable post, and gathered speed and impact with the telegraph, telephone, and radio, have only accelerated and expanded since then. Radar, television, computers, the internet, and cellular and satellite communication have all reshaped the ways we communicate and in so doing reshaped the ways we imagine our communities and the world. Communication technologies have never been more powerful or ubiquitous, yet maps of communication, ironically, may be less visible now than they once were.</p>
<p>Engineers and regulators make maps of cellular telephone coverage or of optical fiber cables, but ordinary users rarely view such maps. Communication today is so fast, easy, and pervasive that most of us do not need to visualize it in geographic terms. An isochrone map like Charles Paullin’s, showing the speed of communication in our own time, would reveal very little. A more characteristic way of mapping twenty-first century communications is the network diagram or social graph, which does away with geographic information altogether, depicting individuals and their interconnections as nodes and lines in abstract space. The discourse surrounding modern communication is all about the eradication of geography. The world, we are told, is small, or flat, or in the palm of our hands. In truth, of course, geography remains. All of our supposedly distance-eradicating media are shaped and defined by local conditions, territorial governments, economic realities, and the earth’s environment itself. But today, more than ever before, we imagine we have transcended distance. And maps of communication, as we have seen, are maps of imagined worlds.</p>

<h3>Further Reading</h3>
<p>Not a great deal has been written on the mapping of communication, but more general works on the history of cartography often visit the subject. John Rennie Short’s <em>Representing the Republic: Mapping the United States, 1600-1900</em> and Susan Schulten’s <em>The Geographical Imagination in America, 1880-1950</em> are excellent books that chart the history of America imagining itself through maps.</p>
<p>There is an extensive body of work on the history of communication in America, with many recent works inspired, at least in part, by the communications revolutions of our own time. Paul Starr’s <em>The Creation of the Media: Political Origins of Modern Communications</em> offers a sweeping survey of American communications from colonial times to the rise of network radio, as do the essays collected in <em>A Nation Transformed by Information</em>, edited by Alfred Chandler and James Cortada. On particular moments in the evolution of American communications, some of the best works include: Richard Brown, <em>Knowledge Is Power: The Diffusion of Information in Early America</em>; Richard John, <em>Spreading the News: The American Postal System from Franklin to Morse and also Network Nation: Inventing American Telecommunications</em>; David Henkin, <em>The Postal Age: The Emergence of Modern Communications in Nineteenth-Century America</em>; David Hochfelder, <em>The Telegraph in America, 1832-1920</em>; and Susan Douglas, <em>Inventing American Broadcasting, 1899-1922</em>. Alexander Russo’s <em>Points on the Dial: Golden Age Radio Beyond the Networks</em> is especially attentive to the geography of early radio. My own book, <em>The People’s Network: The Political Economy of the Telephone in the Gilded Age</em>, tells the story of the telephone, with special attention to the struggle between Bell and the independents for control of North American telecommunications.</p>
<p>Moving farther afield, Richard White’s <em>Railroaded: The Transcontinentals and the Making of Modern America</em> is a trenchant, authoritative history of the industry that did so much to shape both transportation and communication in America. John Durham Peters’ <em>Speaking Into the Air</em> is a beautifully-written history of communication as an idea. Michael O’Malley’s <em>Keeping Watch: A History of American Time</em> chronicles the shift in American consciousness from natural time to standard time and time as commodity. And <em>Einstein’s Clocks, Poincaré’s Maps</em>, by Peter Galison, is a unique exploration of the intellectual and technical webs connecting nineteenth-century trains, telegraphs, maps, and time signals, and how they remade our world.</p>

  return `<p>“The most important question,” the railroad engineer William H. Searles concluded in 1885, “is whether or not to build the line at all.” Normally this began with an investigation of the economic, political, and geographical conditions that might support construction of a railroad. If a railroad promoter got beyond this stage, he would usually assemble a group of like-minded investors, seek a state charter of incorporation, and then start to raise funds for an engineering survey. This fieldwork would then be summarized in a map and a profile (a cross-section showing the changing elevation along the route), like these showing the results of the 1827-28 survey of the future Boston and Albany, one of the earliest American railroads. The Massachusetts Board of Internal Improvements, which sponsored the survey, was anxious to keep pace with New York’s Erie Canal, constructed 1817-25. Surveyor James Baldwin’s map was used in a variety of ways to drum up public support as well as financing, the first of many railroad maps rooted in an engineering tradition pressed into service as a promotional tool.</p>
<p>Baldwin’s survey required two maps, one from Boston to Springfield on the Connecticut River, and one from the Springfield to Albany, totaling sixty-three inches in length. Alternative routes were explored, but Baldwin did not complete his survey of the northern route beyond the Connecticut River because the route’s summit west of the river would be about 500 feet higher than the southern route through Springfield. The report included detailed descriptions of the routes on the map as well as summary considerations of other options investigated. At this date, the Board of Internal Improvements still planned to use horses to pull cars on the rails projected on this map. Indeed, one reason for constructing a profile was to determine whether one or two horses would be needed to pull a car on a particular segment. Furthermore, since the early steam ocomotives lacked the hosepower to ascent steep grades, incline planes might be prescribed, such as those used in the Allegheny mountains of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The completed line departed in some details from the original surveyed course, and was not finished until 1843. A bridge comleting the route across the Hudson River to Albany was not completed until 1866. By then railroads had transformed the New England landscape. Water-powered factories such as the Boston Manufacturing Company textile mill at Waltham were able to expand operations using steam engines powered by coal supplied by the railroad. The daily supply of milk brought in by the railroads encouraged Boston to enact the nation’s first fresh milk ordinance in 1856. Dairy farmers made daily trips into towns along the railroad where the milk trains shuttled their cans back and forth to the city, on roads improved to facilitate the trip. The line envisioned in 1828 was nevertheless a technology in transition from older ones. In many instances early railroads were conceived as links between communities and navigable rivers or canals, rather to supplant them. This very route, for example, was shown on William Norris’s <em>Maps of the Railroads and Canals</em> (1834) as an extension of the Erie Canal.</p>`;

  return `<p>Michel Chevalier toured the United States in 1835-1836 on assignment from the French Ministry of Public Works. A firm believer in the potential of modern technology and public works to improve the quality of life, Chevalier produced this map, versions of which appeared in several of his publications and reports, to spur railroad construction back home. At the time of its publication French engineers and geographers were pioneering new cartographic techniques, now known as thematic mapping, to help bureaucrats, policymakers, and financial interests better understand the physical and social geography, including patterns of trade and movement. Chevalier’s map was among the first to envision the fragmentary collection of mostly local American railroads east of the Appalachian Mountains as part of a national system, still in the making.</p>
<p>Chevalier envisioned a spine of railroads linking major cities and ports along the Atlantic coast, Boston (still isolated from the rest of the system on this map), New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Norfolk, and Charleston. On Chevalier’s map there are significant gaps, and he combined railroads and canals, both proposed and existing, to fill out the system. This combination of railroads, canals, and sometimes roads and turnpikes would remain characteristic of American general and transportation maps for another two decades. These, published by Henry Schenk Tanner, Samuel Augustus Mitchell, and others, were gradually replaced by railroad maps as the trains asserted their dominance. Thus one can start with Chevalier’s national frame and periodically update it with similar systematic maps, decade by decade and watch the rails pull the nation together even as other forces were pulling it apart. Chevalier may have consulted William Norris’s <em>Map of the Railroads and Canals…in the United States</em>, (1834) “drawn and engraved for D. K. Minor, editor of the Railroad Journal.” This large sheet, however, did not conceive of the individual routes as parts of a whole. Instead it featured insets showing the profiles of the major routes, almost all of them waterways. The French visitor, however, saw the advantage of railroads over canals. “I know of nothing that gives a higher idea of the power of man,” he declared, later pointing out that railroads would transform the United States into a continental power. “Distance,” he concluded “will be annihilated, and this colossus, ten times greater than France, will preserve its unity without an effort.”</p>`;

  return `<p>In 1675, John Ogilby published <em>Britannia</em>, the first modern collection of strip maps showing the course of specific routes—in his case, the roads of Great Britain—in detail. This type of publication, imitated in the United States by Christopher Colles in 1789 and Matthew Carey in 1802 was applied to railroad routes by the London publisher James Wyld in 1837, when he began a series of guides for passengers on the various railways radiating out of London. William Guild took up the idea in America a decade later, publishing a more elaborate handbook with strip maps for passengers travelling between Boston and Albany on the Boston and Worcester and Western Railroads. The guide covers the entire 200-mile route in exquisite detail from Boston to Greenbush, New York, where passengers had to take a ferry across the Hudson to proceed to Albany. The author decried the idea of tourists reading newspapers while en route when, encouraging them instead to look out of the windows at the passing scene. The miles from Boston printed in bold type (Miles 94-100 for this segment), helped passengers gauge their progress.</p>
<p>Though the guide took note of the scenery and its natural history, and other objects passed by this line, “bridges, viaducts, tunnels, cuttings, embankments, [and] gradients” receive as much, if not more attention. See, for example, grade level road crossings shown (mile 94), bridges over the tracks (mile 96 at Chickopee Village, where the railroad right-of-way is cut through sand), or where the railroad itself is carried on a viaduct over the road (between miles 99 and 100). In this respect, Guild’s guidebook shares with James Baldwin’s survey of the same route from two decades earlier (Map 1) a keen interest in rail infrastructure and engineering, at a time when rail bridges, viaducts, and even embankments were relative novelties. The Connecticut River wooden truss bridge on granite piers (at mile 99), 1264 feet in length, was a major engineering feature of the route, and Guild accordingly featured it in a separate illustration. Though the map shows two tracks crossing, there was in fact only one, which created a major bottleneck that was not redressed until 1874 when the Connecticut River was crossed by an iron bridge supporting two tracks.</p>
<p>Guild went on to publish similar guides to routes between Boston and New York, along the Hudson River, and from New York City to the White Mountains. A shorter passenger guide to the Boston and Albany Railroad presenting “historical associations and other matters of interest of every town” without maps also appeared in 1847, perhaps with railroad sponsorship. In the 1870s, the railroad sponsored similar publications called “Route Books” and “Panoramic Guides.” These, like similar guidebooks published for other rail routes well into the twentieth century, devoted most of their attention to the history and geography of the passing landscape. But in 1847, the railroad itself was the great marvel and the focal point.</p>`;

  return `<p>In 1850 the Illinois Central Railroad (formally chartered in 1851) became the first of many railroad companies to receive a grant of federal lands for the company to sell to finance its construction. Through these grants railroads engaged in land development, real estate sales, and the recruitment of settlers, both from the United States and abroad. From the beginning maps, such as these from a small atlas published by the Illinois Central in 1854, were part of this process.</p>
<p>The original Illinois Central grant constituted of alternate blocks (the even numbered “sections”) of land in a six-mile corridor, shown as a darker band of grey on the general state map on either side of the railroad’s right-of-way. The other lands in this zone remained in government hands in the hope that their value would at least double as the railroad was built, thus recovering the government’s loss of income from grant lands. Since some land, however, had already been sold before the enactment of the grant, the railroad was allowed to select “indemnity lands” from a band fifteen miles beyond the original grant zone, indicated by the lighter grey line on the general map.</p>
<p>The prominent grid on the index maps outlines the township and range system of land division, established in 1785 to facilitate settlement of the lands of the old Northwest Territory. The system called for the survey and division of most land west of the Appalachians into townships, usually consisting of thirty square-mile sections. The main north-south axis of the survey in Illinois, the Third Principal Meridian, roughly bisects the state parallel to the Illinois Central main line.</p>
<p>The grid allowed prospective buyers to locate parcels of interest on the atlas’s local maps, four of which are illustrated. Three of these maps show lands near the termini of the Y-shaped railroad. Galena, in the far northwestern corner of the state and the center of an important lead-mining region, and Cairo, over 300 miles to the south at the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, were envisioned as the railroad’s termini from the start. Relatively little land remained available (the grey squares on each map) in these areas for the railroad to sell in 1854. No land at all remained for sale along the railroad’s approach to its third terminus, the budding metropolis of Chicago. In 1854 the city’s most important route was the Illinois and Michigan Canal, shown as a bold black line on the sectional map. This waterway, like the railroad, linked Lake Michigan to the Mississippi river system. Plate 29, south of Urbana, with its distinct checkerboard pattern, is more typical of the maps in the atlas. It pictures an area that was still sparsely settled. The brief text on the map observes that Urbana is a “flourishing town” and that the crossing Great Western Rail Road, Later the Wabash Railroad, will someday bring coal from Danville, Illinois, to the east, for the use of settlers and industries along the line of the Illinois Central, and, finally, that the whole of the surrounding country “is in the highest degree fertile and well wooded.”</p>`;

  return `<p>Engineer Edwin F. Johnson was an early proponent of the construction of a transcontinental railroad linking the eastern states to the Pacific Ocean. He first published this map in 1853 to illustrate a series of articles he wrote in support of this idea in the <em>American Railroad Journal,</em> edited by Henry Varnum Poor (see Map 7). These were reprinted as <em>Railroad to the Pacific: Northern Route</em>, in which this copy appears. Johnson’s map coincided with the beginning of the ambitious explorations and surveys collectively known as the Pacific Railroad Surveys (1853-55) undertaken by the Army Corps of Topographical Engineers to find the best route from the Mississippi River to the Pacific Ocean at five different latitudes (see map 6), roughly in the locations of the five western routes delineated on Johnson’s map.</p>
<p>Johnson’s pamphlet describes the relative geographical, topographical, and economic merits of each of the routes under consideration, but the process of choosing the first transcontinental route was embroiled in the rising sectional strife between the North and the South, as well as by regional rivalries, such as that between St. Louis and Chicago, or Memphis and New Orleans. Both the text and map give an impression of objectivity in describing the relative merits of various routes, but Johnson was a northerner, born in Vermont, with a long career in rail and canal engineering in New York and the northern plains. A closer look at the map reveals a subtle argument in advocating the choice of the northern route, which would eventually become the second transcontinental railroad in North America, the Northern Pacific. Johnson himself would become the railroad’s first Chief Engineer in 1866, but he died in 1872, well before the completion of the Northern Pacific mainline in 1883. The Railway’s northerly competitor, the Canadian Pacific, would not be completed until 1885.</p>
<p>The most distinctive feature may be the way in which it displays and sometimes manipulates geographical information to show the proposed northern route in a favorable light. In the East it portrays roads already in operation or under construction, but only if they were oriented in an east-west direction. Chicago is pictured as the possible terminus of two of the five proposed western routes, including the northern route. Its rivals on the Mississippi River, St. Louis, Memphis, and New Orleans anchor the other three. Only a few eastern railroads are delineated, and these are mostly east-west routes that terminate on the Great Lakes or funnel into Chicago. A dashed line running from a point midway between Chicago and its closest rival, St. Louis, to a point on the Atlantic coast equidistant from both cities, shows which cities, states, and associated populations will be closer to either terminus (Chicago to the north of this line and St. Louis to the south), and therefore better served by railroads commencing from them. Simple arithmetic reveals that the majority of the eastern populations would have better access to the west through Chicago than through St. Louis.</p>`;

  return `<p>Popular opinion in the US in agreed by the mid-1850s held that private interests should build and operate any transcontinental railroad, with the federal government supplying generous land grants, loans, and military support. The expenses were apparently so staggering, and the financial returns so meager, that only one such route could be supported. In 1853 Congress authorized the scientific survey of all practical routes between the Mississippi Valley and the nation’s Pacific ports, hoping that a leading candidate would emerge after objective investigation.</p>
<p>The five Pacific Railroad Surveys (1853-55) were among the most ambitious and expensive federal projects undertaken before the Civil War. The surveying parties included surveyors and topographers, of course, but also scientists and artists, who recorded observations of the soils, climate, geology, botany, zoology, ethnography, and landscape. Taken together they were the first comprehensive assessment of the entire territory of the newly acquired territories now known as the American West. The compiled observations of the surveys, published in the twelve-volume <em>Reports of Explorations and Surveys to Ascertain the Most Practicable and Economical Route for a Railroad from the Mississippi River to the Pacific Ocean</em> are a landmark in the history of American science, and laid the foundation for still larger surveys of the West that followed the Civil War.</p>
<p>The two maps and geological profile reproduced here were prepared by the party led by Lieut. Amiel Weeks Whipple that surveyed a possible route near the 35th Parallel of northern latitude, in 1853. The two large maps (Nos. 1 and 2) show the suggested route and the main topographical features of the surrounding country. The solid line running east-west across the two sheets delineates the suggested route, while the dashed lines identify alternates. No single railroad that was built followed the entirety of any one of Whipple’s suggested routes, though in New Mexico, Arizona, and California, the route surveyed roughly parallels the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad mainline. Lighter lines mark the trails of reconnoitering parties and of existing wagon roads. Watercourses, wells, springs, trails, routes of previous explorations, and Indian settlements are also noted. Several inset maps provide greater detail of key points along the suggested route, such as the Pecos River crossing in eastern New Mexico and Campbell’s Pass in western New Mexico. The thoroughness of the map, which supports rich comparative reading with more recent maps, might obscure the expedition’s main purpose, which was to identify a feasible railroad route.</p>
<p>The third map is a cross-section of the main geological formations underlying the route prepared Jules Marcou, geologist to Whipple’s expedition, gives some indication both of the scientific ambitions of the Pacific Railroad Surveys and of their practical orientation. These were among the first attempts to grasp the geological complexities of the West, a matter of great interest to anyone interested in developing its mineral and agricultural potential. Though the profile greatly exaggerates the relative heights of the mountains and valleys, we gain as well some sense of the difficulties the terrain posed to railroad construction.</p>`;

  return `<p>Henry Varnum Poor (1812-1905), a lawyer from Bangor, Maine, decided to concentrate his energies on the railroad business after his brother promoted a line between Montreal and Portland, Maine. In 1849 he purchased the <em>American Railroad Journal</em>, a trade publication founded in 1832 to stimulate public interest in the new industry. Poor transformed it into a journal for investors and soon emerged as the railroads’ major spokesman to the investment community. After the Civil War he founded a yearly publication, the <em>Manual of the Railroads in the United States</em>. Poor’s <em>Manual</em>, published with his son, became the bible of American railroading until 1924, when it merged with another publication.</p>
<p>The detailed, large map reproduced here is one of several similar maps published during the 1850s for display on a wall. The decorative cartouche at lower right features a locomotive getting up a head of steam, pulling several passenger cars, while a child picking flowers in a field with his family, waves at the engineer and fireman. Literally, the train is a machine in the garden, bringing modern mobility and prosperity to the entire country with the blessing of Lady Liberty. The extent of the map shows that in 1854 these blessings were geographically limited to the eastern half of the country. California did not get its first railroad until 1855, but lines proposed in Texas, Kansas, and Nebraska in the next few years would soon require a national railroad map to extend its coverage.</p>
<p>The less than careful eye might read this map somewhat optimistically, as if an integrated national railroad network were already in place. Poor is careful, however, to distinguish between railroads in operation, those under construction, and those projected for future construction. Several railroads, including the Pennsylvania, the Baltimore and Ohio, and the Virginia and Tennessee, have conquered the barrier of the Appalachian Mountains. It appears on the map that the Mississippi River has been bridged at several points, though the first railroad bridge across that formidable barrier, at Rock Island, Illinois, was not completed until 1856. The map likewise has nothing to say about the differences in railroad gauges then in effect. Five major gauges ranging from 4’8 ½” to 6’ were in use at the time. Fifteen states would decide on a single gauge by the end of the decade, but these would not agree in width, being split largely into Northern and Southern systems.</p>
<p>A closer look at the map also reveals that the majority of the named rail lines do not actually extend beyond state boundaries. Most of the states conceived of transportation facilities in their territory as “state systems.” They chartered railroads for construction and operation only within their jurisdictions. Railroad companies, and their stockholders, nevertheless created and invested in affiliated lines in adjacent states. The formal integration of these lines into national and regional companies accelerated after the Civil War, a process encouraged by the proliferation of railroad land grants and the construction of the first transcontinental routes.</p>`;

  return `<p>The New Orleans, Jackson, and Great Northern Railroad (NOJ&amp;GN) completed its 206-mile route from the Crescent City to Canton, Mississippi in 1858. Two years later, a connecting line, the Mississippi Central, continued north as far Jackson, Tennessee, with ambitions to link up with to the Illinois Central Railroad (map 4). This was not achieved, however, until a rail bridge was built across the Ohio River at Cairo, Illinois in 1889. By then, the Illinois Central had acquired both of the southern railroads. During the Civil War the NOJ&amp;GN was a Confederate lifeline and a major object of Union attacks. The former Confederate General P. G. T. Beauregard assumed the presidency of the railroad after the war, and set about rebuilding the line. It may well have been Beauregard who, about 1871 or 1872, engaged a young German artist named Rothas to create this atlas of the route.</p>
<p>This type of atlas is called a track book because it features the railroad’s right of way. Rothas’s complete work of 261 pages forms a continuous strip map and natural and cultural features on each side of the route. The format is similar to working track charts consulted by officials in charge of the operation and maintenance of the facilities, but its artistry may indicate that it also had public relations functions. Indeed, it may be an artistic version of a more prosaic, practical work. Track charts from this era rarely survive, since they were usually discarded in favor of more current editions.</p>
<p>The first image shows roughly the first mile of the route from its southern terminus in New Orleans at the passenger depot at Calliope and Magnolia Streets. After crossing a small canal (today’s Claiborne Avenue) the route traverses a swamp via a causeway. This swamp has since been drained and subdivided into city blocks, a reminder of the precarious balance between land and water that has shaped the history and geography of New Orleans.</p>
<p>The next opening shows the NOJ&amp;GN’s approach to Amite, Louisiana, near Milepost 68 from New Orleans. The map features a mix of wooded areas and cleared land south of town. This was cotton country at the time, and near the 67.5 milepost a railroad siding provides access to a cotton gin factory. Though marked “Smith’s” map, this may be the site of the Gullett Gin Company, a manufacturer of cotton gins permanently established in Amite after 1869. The local woodlands provided the adjacent sawmill with abundant lumber essential to the manufacture of the gins.</p>
<p>The third opening depicts the surroundings of the line’s passenger depot in Jackson, Mississippi. A street railroad, powered by horses, leads from the station into town. Two hotels occupy the land directly across from the depot. Railroad yards lie just beyond, with the freight depot located near the marker for mile 183. The whole is dominated by the complex angular crossing of the Vicksburg (“Vicksberg”) &amp; Meridian Rail Road, with its attendant yards and facilities, including a scale for weighing bulk commodities.</p>`;

  return `<p>In October 1872 the printing firm of Rand, McNally, and Company announced the formation of a Map Engraving Department to capitalize on a new printing technique now known as wax engraving. This process greatly reduced the cost of producing colorful maps, making it possible for railroads to give them away with timetables and promotional publications. This early example was prepared as an accompaniment to a commemorative booklet published by the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) at the Centennial Exposition of 1876, staged in Philadelphia. By then, the company enjoyed a reputation as an efficient, profitable business, in the process of becoming the world’s largest company in terms of revenue. Its stock attracted investors by the thousands, eventually hundreds of thousands, because one could count on it to pay dividends, every year in fact from 1856 until 1968. The PRR was an adroit practitioner of public relations, as shown by this map, which went through multiple editions and printings in 1876 and undoubtedly found its way onto the walls of offices, schools, depots, and homes across the nation.</p>
<p>The featured national map offers a general, if selective, view of the national rail network that emphasizes the geographical position of the PRR. As is typical of promotional maps, the Pennsylvania trunk lines reaching from New York to Chicago and St. Louis are shown with bold lines to distinguish them from connecting and competing lines. The conic projection used for the map cuts off much of the Pacific Northwest, and the inset map of the world covers up most of the Southwest, conveniently screening from view two regions not served by connections to the PRR. An uncritical reader might also conclude that the Pennsylvania is the only railroad that enters Philadelphia, the site of the exposition. The map notably excludes the rival Philadelphia and Reading Railroad, which operated a network of lines in southeastern Pennsylvania and adjacent New Jersey. In the lower left corner is truncated world map, “Round the world across the American Continent via the Pennsylvania Railroad,” intended to show the Pennsylvania had a global reach. This map shows the PRR tracks connecting seamlessly with the transcontinental railroad and with shipping lines extending the route to the shores of Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>The reverse side of the sheet presents a gallery of images and text extolling the speed, modernity, and extent of the PRR and its affiliated lines, as well as the pleasures of a trip on one of its routes. Below a banner boasting “The Pennsylvania Railroad is the Great Trunk Line and Fast Mail Route of the United States” are pictures of luxurious passenger cars, an efficient double-tracked roadbed traversing a mountainous landscape, and scenic wonders visible from the windows of Pennsylvania trains. Perhaps the most powerful of these pictures is at bottom center, showing no less than four trains traversing the famous horseshoe curve in the Allegheny Mountains near Altoona, Pennsylvania, one of the engineering wonders of the age.</p>`;

  return `<p>The maps appearing on this two-sided leaflet published in 1873 by the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad (ATSF; founded in 1869), during the early stages of the construction of the railroad, are typical of those found in promotional publications issued by Midwestern and Western land grant railroads in the decades after the Civil War. The design of all maps, we are reminded, is influenced in some measure by the interests and views of the people and organizations that produce them. What is notable about railroad promotional maps is the degree to which these inevitable selections and distortions are purposely manipulated to pursue the sponsor’s objectives.</p>
<p>The map on the front of the unfolded leaflet, bearing the stamp of a land agent for the railroad named C.P. Bolmar, favorably presents the general geographical position of the ATSF. Bold lines representing major connecting railroads seem to reach out in all directions to the east from Atchison, the eastern terminus of the railroad. To the west of this point only the recently built ATSF track across Kansas. The map barely acknowledges the existence of the rival Kansas and Pacific Railroad or the transcontinental line of the Union Pacific. Territories and states to the north and the south are cropped out, so as to avoid mention of still other lines competing for settlers throughout the Great Plains. The map optimistically shows the projected extensions of the ATSF, although the line would not reach New Mexico until 1878 and the Pacific Ocean until 1887. The scale is also manipulated for effect, making Kansas look closer to the Pacific Ocean than it actually is. A careful eye will notice that the width of Illinois is also exaggerated, relative to Iowa, Indiana and other states. This enabled the cartographer to feature many railroads in Illinois, suggesting that the map’s target audience may have lived in Illinois. In 1874 Illinois accounted for four times as many purchasers of land from the Santa Fe as any other state.</p>
<p>The large map of Kansas on the back of the leaflet provides local geographical details that might be important to potential land purchasers, including county names and boundaries, existing cities and towns, rivers, and connecting railroads. Near the map’s lower left corner is a small diagram explaining how the square townships established by the surveys of the US General Land Office are typical subdivided into thirty-six sections.</p>
<p>The extensive text accompanying almost all of these maps provides information about the land and the towns along the line, advice on how to select lands as well as how to raise and market livestock and crops. There is usually a financial section which provides sample prices and terms of sale highlighted by examples of different ways to make a purchase. The text in this instance ends with an offer of low round-trip rates from Atchison for prospective purchasers who are called “explorers,” a final bit of advertising flattery.</p>`;

The folder, divided into ten panels on the recto, used three of them for a system map of the entire line from the Maine port city to Montreal, Ogdensburg, and Buffalo. The other panels provided information about the White Mountain resort area and the railroad service. Two views are included, one showing Mt. Washington from the “Turnpike near Fabyanʼs.” The caption then hastens to add “Seen also from P.&amp;O.R.R.” The whole point of the map on the verso documents this addendum, pointing out how the tracks penetrate the mountains, proceeding all the way through the Notch, offering “delightful scenery” as well as ready access to the resorts. The tourist, the leaflet points out, as “the Mountains close in before him…[will be] brought face to face with all their changing form and rugged outlines.” </p>
<p>The Fabyan House, used as a key location both on the map and in the text, opened with a gala celebration in 1873 just before the start of a long depression. The hotel with accommodations for five hundred guests replaced two earlier resorts by that name which had successively burned to the ground, the last one in 1868. The railroad arrived in August 1875, an event duly sketched by an artist (reproduced in Christopher Johnson, <em>This Grand Magnificent Place: The Wilderness Heritage of the White Mountains</em>, Hanover NH, 2006, 130). Now that the hard times of the 1870s were over, the railroad issued this elaborate folder to attract customers. Even today the map is compelling, leading its readers to trace routes, imagine scenery, and search out places for lodging, to visit on a hike, or to enjoy a picnic. </p>
<p>Well-known markers, familiar even today, set the geography in place. Mt. Washington is near the center of the sheet, at the end of a short branch leading eastward from the Fabyan House on the main line. Just north of the highest peak, other promontories marking the Presidential Range are named for Jefferson, Adams, and Madison respectively. Whiteface Mountain is labeled at the lower center while the village of Conway marks the southeast entryway to the Notch. At the other end of the pass the Connecticut River swings into view. Note that the American Bank Note Company has provided a grid for the map, each line set at a ten minute interval, as well as a helpful scale of miles. </p>`;

The base map was produced by the railroad on the occasion, in that very year, 1885, of its completion across the continent. This explains the inset world map showing the land and sea route from Great Britain to China and the tables of distances at the right-hand side and the note, “by permission of the Can. P. Rʼy. Co.,” under the mapʼs title. </p>
<p>The railroad started as a government effort to unify Canada after 1871 when British Columbia, a separate British colony, joined the Dominion. By 1880, after little progress had been made, the government offered a subsidy plus a land grant to a group of investors to construct the line. The map therefore presents a triumph in both engineering and nationalism. The last spike was driven on November 7, 1885 and shortly thereafter a military train traversed the entire route, leaving Halifax and arriving in Vancouver before the line was shut down in the Rockies by the severe winter. Even earlier in the year the uncompleted tracks had moved troops and supplies from eastern installations to the Saskatchewan district where Metis and Native American groups resisted the push toward a unified nation. </p>
<p>The British War Office took note of this example of the value of railroads in mobilizing military force around the globe, producing a similar map in outline format in 1886. Moreover, the Canadian Pacific Railway, from the very beginning, put its system maps in a global context, using “Around the World” as their motto and even using a world map on polar projection to show its global importance (folding map by Poole Brothers, Chicago, 1912, reproduced in Modelski 1984, 58-159). As one commentator noted in 1886, the Canadian Pacific Railway was the new Northwest Passage. </p>`;

A trip by rail along the south shore of Lake Superior would not only fit the bill, but would also offer a convenient short cut for a transcontinental journey because the Duluth, South-Shore, &amp; Atlantic tracks connected with the Canadian Pacific Railway eastward to Montreal and with the Northern Pacific westward to Seattle and Tacoma. </p>
<p>The Duluth, South-Shore, &amp; Atlantic Railway was a new company, assembled in 1887 from several short lines, each mostly carrying ore and logs to lake ports. It would not have its own route all the way along Lake Superior until 1892, previously using a Northern Pacific route at its western reach. Although the Passenger Department made a valiant effort to secure customers, this service was never successful. A second version of the book and map came out in 1891 under the title, <em>Along the Bowstring</em>, but tourist traffic did not justify continuing the effort. Nevertheless, the road survived until the 1990s when it merged with the Wisconsin Central and was then absorbed by the Soo Line Railroad. </p>
<p>The most striking feature of the map is its horizon and view of the sky across the top five inches of the sheet. The Great Lakes and many smaller lakes scattered across the image reflect its pleasant azure color. The coolness of the blue is balanced by the light brown of the land. Towns along the railroads are designated by clusters of buildings. The picture is elongated at the center to emphasize the South Shore route and to stretch the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and Wisconsin, the location of many sights of nature sketched in the book. </p>
<p>The map, like the pen and ink drawings, suggests a peaceful world along the South Shore, a world filled with interesting places presented in a relaxed mood. An educational “Sketch of the Geology of the Marquette and Keweenawan Districts” by the Michigan State Geologist, which concludes the accompanying book, would seem to break this mood of repose, its author encouraging its readers to make “worthy use of leisure time.” The map balances the scientific essay with the dream-inducing sky, a canopy over the railroad system with a town-filled world next to a reminder that the ores underground are the root of the railroad’s existence. </p>`;

  return `<p>By 1876 Rand, McNally and Company had decided to produce a business atlas especially addressed to everyone concerned with shipping goods and materials. Apparently it had in mind, at first, a kind of supplementary volume to those atlases readily available from Eastern publishers like Asher and Adams, but one with an emphasis on the western states. It soon discovered that national coverage was prerequisite to a successful product. Thus, although it issued its first business atlas “of the Great Mississippi Valley and Pacific Slope” in late 1876, it was superseded weeks later by a business atlas with national coverage. The 1877 volume, in 212 pages, emphasized that it featured a “new and original compilation and ready reference index…[to] the entire railroad system of the North America,” with a special page to explain all the abbreviations and to demonstrate how the index system worked by using the Ohio map as an example.</p>
<p>Another Chicago publisher, the Cram Atlas Company, had issued a similar <em>New Commercial Atlas of the United States</em>, perhaps the first comprehensive atlas published west of the Alleghenies, in 1875. But it was only seventy-five pages in length and lacked the elaborate indexing system. Both Chicago publishers continued to issue successor atlases, but the Rand, McNally version, under continuous development and expansion, soon became the standard reference work. It appeared in annual editions starting in 1877 and continued until 2010.</p>
<p>By 1887 it was revised four times each year to keep it current and a purchaser, called a subscriber by the company, would receive a copy of the quarterly changes free of charge for two years. Regular updates were needed because trackage was then expanding by hundreds of miles each month. An advertisement in Poorʼs Manual for 1887 pointed out that this meant a price of “Only 50 cents per month for a book that has cost over $25,000 to make.” By then the huge, heavy atlas featured ninety-two large scale double-page maps, mostly of American states and cities. By 1909, however, the railroad system had reached maturity and the quarterly updates were no longer needed. By then motor vehicles were starting to move public interest to road maps. Thus the map of Florida featured here should be viewed as one in a long series within each annual edition of this atlas, later called the <em>Commercial Atlas</em>, documenting the development of each state in large, attractive, and authoritative maps. The inset map, on a larger sale, of Lake, Orange, and Volusia (Seminole) counties, perhaps looks to the future. So do the township and range survey sections which give structure to the state by real estate references, perhaps with an eye to forthcoming land sales. After the tourist boom of the 1890s, largely inspired by the railroads, Florida and its maps would never be the same.</p>
<p>In 1892 Henry Flagler started building his railroad empire in Florida, reaching Miami in 1896. A decade later he pushed on toward Key West utilizing a series of long bridges. In 1909, as this map shows, the route was only partially completed. Three more years would be needed to bring this “eighth wonder of the world” to completion. Then, in 1935, a hurricane would ruin much of the route, a tale that can be followed cartographically using the annual sequence of maps in the <em>Commercial Atlas</em>.</p>`;

  return `<p>The Railroad Commission of Georgia periodically issued maps of the state such as this attractive sheet. It not only shows the routes of the various lines but identifies each one with a color-coded initial system. The color adds to the attractive character of the map, but, because about seventy separate lines are listed in the key at the bottom of the sheet, it is not very helpful. Although dozens of separate companies are identified, many of these were jointly controlled by outright ownership, financial domination, or leasehold arrangements. But, since each company in a legal sense sent in a separate annual report to the state agency, each was listed separately on the map. Totaling up the miles of trackage on these reports also gave the map an authoritative character in the precise note: “Railroad Mileage in Operation June 30, 1915: 7,325.72.” </p>
<p>The map also served as a general map of the state and as a promotional tool. Note the use of easy-to-read symbols to indicate mountains in the northwest part of the state and the Okepenoke Swamp in the southeast corner. The addition of an inset map to show congressional districts and soil types extends the use of the map, pushing it away from its original purpose as a railroad map toward a broader function as a general reference tool. Hence the map is covered with place names and has a convenient index system to locate them on the reverse side of the sheet. </p>
<p>This particular version, however, was pasted on canvas and furnished with rollers for use as a wall map, perhaps in a Georgia classroom or courthouse. To locate places a reader could use Rand, McNallyʼs <em>Business Atlas</em>, which had an even more detailed index to “counties, creeks, islands, lakes, rivers, and towns,” as well as flag stops and hamlets along the railroads.</p>`;

  return `<p>Almost from the beginning railroads in the United States used timetables to organize the movement of trains. They represented a marked improvement over travel by stagecoach, sail, or even steamboat. The first timetables appeared in local newspapers, using local times. They soon became promotional devices as well as information sheets and were printed as broadsides, on cardboard, for display at hotels and depots. Timetables from various lines were soon compiled into railroad guides so that passengers could arrange trips with suitable connections from one railroad to another. By the 1870s, with the advent of lower paper and printing costs, along with competition between competing lines, promotional timetables, often with maps, became common. These sheets, printed on both sides and folded into panels, assumed a standard format by the end of the nineteenth century. </p>
<p>This example, from 1920, celebrates the company’s completion of its transcontinental line in the early twentieth century. The Milwaukee Road, as it was popularly known, began laying rails in 1850 as the Milwaukee and Mississippi Rail Road. Then, through a series of mergers and acquisitions, it gained access to St. Paul and Chicago. In 1905 it was a major Midwestern system, but had to rely on other lines to reach the Pacific Coast. In a bold move it decided to extend its reach from South Dakota all the way to Puget Sound. In May 1909 a “last spike” ceremony signaled success, although a key tunnel through the Cascade Mountains was not put into use until 1915. </p>
<p>By then another daring decision was being implemented, the electrification of the mountainous sections of the Puget Sound Extension. Note that this timetable map of 1920 points to the two electrified sections just completed which made the Milwaukee Road among the world’s longest electrified railways. For passengers, the smooth, gearless ride uncluttered by smoke and soot gave them, according to the personalized itinerary sheets which accompanied each passenger, an “interesting journey,” without “weary moments” which would lead to “a liberal education in the progress and development of that section of the west traversed route.” </p>
<p>The map was distorted, in typical railroad fashion, probably using an old route map because it shrinks its scale as it proceeds westbound from the former South Dakota railhead. Thus the electrified segments are actually de-emphasized by the map, a shortcoming that was soon corrected in subsequent timetable maps. </p>
<p>A more serious fault, however, lay in the company’s bold moves just before and after First World War, which proved to be a challenging time for US railroads in general. Although we can applaud the ecological advantage of the electric locomotives generating power when moving downhill, and returning this current to the grid, the economic benefits were never fully realized and in 1925 the Milwaukee Road was left bankrupt by its huge capital investments.</p>`;

  return `<p>In the early twentieth century La Salle Extension University in Chicago started a program to train traffic agents for the American business world. Since almost all freight moved by rail at the time, railroad rate structures were the central concern of the course. Moreover, railroad rates were regulated by both state and federal agencies, and often influenced by regional railroad associations. Thus the setting of rates and the selection of shipping venues had become very complex. In order to provide materials for this course of study the school apparently put together a loose-leaf atlas of traffic maps in 1913. </p>
<p>The collection was originally edited by the instructor, William Arthur Shelton, associated from time to time with the Traffic Bureau of the Chicago and Northwestern Railway. Revised versions of the atlas appeared from time to time over the next decade or so, with the current instructors usually listed as editors. Wayne Edgar Butterbough, Charles E. Wyoming, and P. H Banks are associated with some issues of the atlas. Versions would be a better term than editions because even in a single year, like the 1925 copy used here, the atlas used for each course offering could vary markedly in the assigned editorship, maps selected, and their order of appearance. </p>
<p>These attempts “to present comprehensive and accurate information…not to be found elsewhere in one place” (from a 1913 printing) furnished students with a cartographic gold mine. This 1925 version includes a map of interurban (electrified light rail) freight routes in the Middle West sponsored by the Central Electric Traffic Association. Most interurban railroad maps focus on passenger service and on state systems. This map reminds us of the freight traffic on these lines and casts the routes into a regional context (Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio and Michigan). The map notes that the association accounts for “5000 miles of electric railway service, but also documents the fragmentary nature of the system and how it best served local hubs like Indianapolis, Dayton, Cleveland, and Detroit. </p>
<p>On a national scale, the <em>Atlas</em> is a convenient place to find a map of the Ripley Plan for the consolidation of railroads in the United States. Congress directed the Interstate Commerce Commission to prepare such a proposal in 1920. William Z. Ripley, a professor of economics at Harvard worked on the plan until 1929 when the Great Depression made the concept obsolete. The map showing the nineteen proposed systems as it stood in 1925 was developed by the La Salle Extension University using a C. S. Hammond &amp; Co. base map. A chart on the following page indicated which railroads would be assigned to each group. </p>
<p>The <em>Atlas</em> also included a collection of over forty railroad system maps such as that for the Southern Railway and its affiliates shown here. In addition, the book includes a series of railroad territorial maps like the one illustrating Southern freight routes in schematic fashion. Other forms of transportation are included in the general reference section of the Atlas: inland waterways, pipe lines, highways, airway routes, and the like.</p>`;

  return `<p>This manuscript map was probably reproduced as blueprint copies or by way of some other reproduction system to provide working papers for field workers and supervisors. Compiled by the Milwaukee Road and the Kansas City Southern Joint Agency, it gives the “lay of the land” from a railroader’s perspective, at a huge industrial complex in Kansas City, Missouri. The juncture of the Kansas and Missouri Rivers provides a central focus for the map and enables an outside reader to relate the image to any map of the nation as a whole. The cartographer has provided a directional signal just to the left of the mouth of the Kansas River, indicating that the drawing is not set according to the cardinal directions but seems to follow the rough curve of the major stem of tracks from West End in Kansas to Leeds Junction in Missouri, where the Kansas City Southern mainline heads south to Port Arthur, Texas. Leeds Junction is where the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad tracks enter the Woodswether Industrial District which was erected on land once part of the riverbed. </p>
<p>A host of factories, warehouses, and other facilities are labeled on the map according to the companies that use them. These buildings are not outlined; only their locations are noted. To fully reconstruct the past geography of the complex a modern researcher would need a fire insurance atlas of the complex. Instead, here the cartographer focuses on the trackage, providing lists of the car capacity of each track in the various yards and sidings. Each of these yards has a name, like Broadway or Elmdale, giving a human touch to an engineering document. For administrative purposes, however, the railroads have divided the complex into numbered zones. One would guess that this working document was used to help move, distribute, and store the cars bringing raw materials and taking away finished products from the manufacturing facilities crowding the complex. </p>
<p>The names of the companies bring the map to life, from the Fisher Body, Chevrolet, and General Motors Parts Corp. tracks clustered north of the Leeds Yard to the Hershey Wholesale Grocery Company at the end of the Grand Avenue Ally Track on the inset which enlarges the scale for a particularly crowded area. The names near the roundhouse in zone 4A also furnish insight into the operation of freight railroads in 1945: Cinder Pit, Clam Shell, Coal Shute, Fuel Oil, Coal Storage, Store House, Runaround, Roundhouse Lead, and even, in a sign pointing to the future, Diesel Tracks. There is also an interesting “cartographic silence” on the map. It features parts of two states: Kansas and Missouri, but the boundary line does not appear on the map. Railroad maps often erase political boundaries. </p>`;

  return `<p>The 1950s spelled the end of the line for most of the passenger railroads in the United States. Long unprofitable from a variety of perspectives, rail service declined sharply after the Second World as Americans turned to the highways and airways for travel. In 1956 President Eisenhower signed the act creating the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways. Two years later the Boeing 707 jetliner inaugurated commercial jet service. Then, rather than subsidize rail travel in addition to constructing new highways and airports, the Interstate Commerce Act of 1958 streamlined the process by which companies could abandon passenger service. As the number of trains dropped each year it became apparent that only a federal effort could save even the shell of a national rail passenger system. </p>
<p>The National Railroad Passenger Act of 1970 envisioned service to all of the nationʼs metropolitan areas with lines passing through all of the states, something similar to the Interstate Highways. On May 1, 1971, the newly named Amtrak service started operations but, as this, its second timetable map indicates, the system left out states like Maine, Arkansas, and South Dakota, and cities like Cleveland and Dallas had only “added” or “as soon as possible” service. Moreover, the map was misleading because many of the routes, especially in the West, operated only three days a week. </p>
<p>Three railroads still offering passenger service in 1971 did not join Amtrak but, as this map indicates, their trains were limited to one or two routes. Moreover, Amtrak in 1971 did not own the trackage or right-of-way, only the right to run trains and ownership of the rolling stock, equipment, and stations. Federal subsidies subsequently kept the system operating, added some additional trains and routes, aided the purchase of new equipment and even some rights-of-way. After the terrorist strike of 9-11, the nation gained some appreciation for Amtrak and the development of high-speed rail corridors, but whether current plans and proposals will come to fruition remains a question.</p>`;

  return `<p>After the Civil War, as farmers in the Granger Movement organized protests against the discriminatory rates used by railroads, questions were raised about what constituted a fair return on the costs of constructing and operating the various lines. Therefore, a value had to be determined for the “hard” assets of a company. Various state agencies started making such appraisals, but, on the federal level, the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) only sought such information as cases came before it. By 1910, the utility of systematic valuation became obvious and the ICC urged Congress to give it such authority and to finance the collection of data. </p>
<p>The Railroad Valuation Act of 1913 put such a program into action and the Bureau of Valuation started collecting inventory data from the various companies to make a tentative valuation based on 1914 prices. This estimate could then be contested by the lines and the work had to be periodically updated. Maps such as this were central to the effort. They were usually supplied by each individual railroad and varied in format, scope and use. But they are a treasure house of information and currently housed in the National Archives in College Park, MD. This storehouse contains about 117,500 such maps gathered as early as 1910 with updated sheets in a few cases lasting until 1974. Sometimes duplicate copies and supporting materials can be found in the archives of individual lines. </p>
<p>Note that this example, from the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railway, shows its depot and related buildings at Itasca, Illinois, in the dairy belt surrounding Chicago. Two sheds stored the milk cans which came and went each day. The platforms of wood by the station on the “to Chicago” side balanced a crushed stone and brick facility with a concrete curb on the outbound side. The siding at the upper left beyond a commodious outhouse for toilets, led to additional facilities such as a stock yard with a scale, a “pickle station,” several warehouses, a coal station and two lumberyards. Some of these facilities were probably not owned by the railroad, but their presence may have added value to their siding in an appraisal. Or, perhaps the company submitted one of its own working documents to the ICC. It’s also possible that the data, especially the details on street crossings with automatic gates, flashing lights and curbing may have been submitted to the Illinois Commerce Commission. In any event, the Itasca sheet provides a useful window into a railroad village in 1919, giving us an interesting comparison to the big city facility presented in Selection 9. </p>
<p>The map of Mile 11, immediately to the east of this sheet, shows an old well, thirty-five feet deep and six feet in diameter, built of stone, that had been used to provide water for the boilers on the steam locomotives. The depth of the well suggests that it was pumped by hand because its depth was just beyond the height generally accessible to hydraulic ram pumps, also in use at the time, before gas and electric water pumps became common. A bunkhouse, toilet (outhouse) and several sheds stood nearby, pointing to Itasca as a place for railroad maintenance as well as a watering station, suggesting ways the railroad was integrated into the life of this small village. Indeed, the railroad had created the town when it laid its tracks in 1873.</p>`;

  return `<p>Despite the dramatic name, the “Falls of the Ohio” are not rapids. They are formed by a mass of limestone that lies under the entire width of the river for two miles, effectively forming a natural dam. For ten months of the year, the low stages of the river made navigation hazardous. Thomas Hutchins had originally noted this problem in his 1766 study of the US watersheds, which led Thomas Jefferson to speculate on the potential improvements to the river as early as 1781, years before national independence; Christopher Colles also suggested a canal in 1783, though nothing came of his suggestion.</p>
<p>In 1804, the residents of Louisville organized the state-chartered Ohio Canal Company and hired the local engineer and surveyor Jared Brooks to study and map the falls in order to design a canal that would be built on the Kentucky side of the river. Brooks’s map and related graphs identify the challenges to such a canal, and the plan for its construction through Shippingport and Louisville, which is the route that the canal ultimately took when it was completed a few decades later. The map makes clear just how consequential the canal would be for Louisville, especially by widening its access to the river and making it an attractive port. Shippingport had grown quickly in the 1810s, but the canal would end the town’s fortunes by circumventing it entirely.</p>
<p>Brooks estimated the costs of the project at under $200,000. The Kentucky legislature and governor asked Congress to support the canal, using Brooks’s work to argue that improvements to Ohio River navigation were essential to the national interest. This request brought the proposal to the attention of Treasury Secretary Albert Gallatin, who in 1807 was ordered to survey the nation’s transportation infrastructure. In his report Gallatin approvingly described an elaborate proposal to simplify navigation on the Ohio River by circumventing the falls near Louisville. Despite Gallatin’s support, no funding was forthcoming from Congress.</p>
<p>The rapid growth of steamboat commerce after 1812 made such an improvement more urgent. But despite the efforts of Brooks and Gallatin, as well as several others, the canal was not finished until December 1830, after the Commonwealth of Kentucky chartered the Louisville and Portland Canal Company in 1825. The ownership of the canal was a matter of considerable controversy, for it raised questions of national versus local jurisdiction and power. Repeated efforts in Congress to put the canal under Federal control were blocked, though by 1855 Federal ownership was nearly complete.</p>`;

  return `<p>When the United States acquired the Louisiana Territory in 1803, knowledge about the Far West remained limited. Americans knew little—if anything—about the land they had just purchased from France. Amidst such geographical ignorance, wishful thinking thrived, such as Thomas Jefferson’s hope for river portage that would link the Pacific with the drainage of the Mississippi River. As John Allen has written, it was commonly assumed at the time that rivers remained navigable all the way to their sources, which raised the possibility that the headwaters of the Missouri might offer a passage to the Columbia, and hence the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>The expedition of Meriwether Lewis and William Clark ended such dreams and replaced them with a spectacularly complex picture of the American Northwest. The expedition yielded tremendous detail of the course and geography of the Missouri River drainage basin, linking it with the Mississippi River. Equally valuable was the voluminous information brought back about the tribes, flora, and fauna of the Northwest.</p>
<p>William Clark’s map exemplifies this new, more detailed picture of the west that emerged after the expedition, though its provenance is unclear. It was copied from the larger hand-drawn map of William Clark, completed in 1810, and offered the most comprehensive picture of this territory at the time. Clark’s map revealed more geographical distance and topographic complexity in the Rocky Mountains, showing a detailed system of rivers that included the Missouri, the Clearwater, the Columbia, and the Snake. The entire Rocky Mountain system in the north is no less detailed, showing the intermountain region as well as hydrographic drainage.</p>
<p>Yet for all the advances in geographical knowledge yielded by the expedition, some important myths persisted about the possibilities for movement within the West. One of these was that the headwaters of the great western rivers were close to one another in the central Rocky Mountains, a myth that would not be definitively disproven until the 1840s.</p>`;

  return `<p>In 1816 a petition proposing a canal from the Hudson River to Lake Erie was submitted to the New York legislature, complete with over 100,000 signatures from individuals around the state. DeWitt Clinton, the chief advocate of the canal, was derided for his outsized ambition; Thomas Jefferson himself called the project “a little short of madness.” But the proposal to build a canal extending 350 miles passed the legislature, and it opened eight years later. Indeed, when completed in 1825 the 363 mile long canal was far longer than any in Europe, and the economic results were astounding: The canal cut the cost of moving freight by over ninety percent and helped to establish New York City as the port serving a vast hinterland of the Middle West.</p>
<p>The canal route had been mapped as early as 1811, and proposals for a canal reach back further than that. But these were delayed somewhat by the War of 1812, which ironically also demonstrated the utility of an inland waterway to the western frontier. This 1821 map of the proposed canal is an updated version of the original published in 1817, both showing the proposed route and the elevation involved. The mapped route was based on information from surveys and maps made by engineers who detailed particular areas of the route and the obstacles it faced. While the idea for the canal was not new—US Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin had proposed a route from the Hudson River to Lake Ontario and further in his 1807 report on canals and roads—it was immensely ambitious, as the map illustrates. In part, the challenge was one of elevation, for the land rises over 600 feet from the Hudson River to Lake Erie, which required over fifty locks to traverse. The map identified towns to be served by the canal, as well as the connecting rivers and roads that could both aid the canal but also present competing transportation.</p>
<p>The 1820s saw a frenzy not just of canal building, but of canal maps: On most subsequent maps of New York the canal appeared as an inset, a source of tremendous pride and profit for the state. The historian Carter Goodrich called the Erie Canal “the most decisive single event in the history of American transportation,” one which stimulated seventeen other canal surveys in the nation.</p>`;

  return `<p>In 1838 the United States Exploring Expedition began a four-year trek that would take it around the world. The expedition yielded particularly important information about the area many in the US called the Oregon Country, and known in British circles as the Columbia District of the Hudson’s Bay Company. The Exploring Expedition explored the Pacific Coast from the Strait of Juan de Fuca to the Columbia River Valley, then south to lower Columbia and Fort Vancouver, and into the Willamette Valley, then concluding with an overland trek to the San Francisco Bay. It came at an important time. By 1841, when this map was published, there had been US emigration to the disputed Oregon Country for a decade, and the republic eyed the region with increasing interest, though it was also claimed by British and Russian interests as well as local Native peoples.</p>
<p>The expedition yielded several maps, including nautical charts and thematic maps. The most important was that of the “Oregon Territory,” drawn in 1841 and published with Wilkes’s extensive report in 1844. At the time it was the most detailed map of the region north of the Sacramento River. It was accompanied by an inset map of the Columbia River that noted Indian settlements. The map was compiled just as John C. Fremont’s own expedition into the area east of the Rocky Mountains also bore fruit, and Wilkes even acknowledges this on the map. In turn, Joseph Drayton’s survey of the Columbia River (inset) enabled Fremont to construct his detailed “Map of an Exploring Expedition to the Rocky Mountains in 1845, encompassing the entire Trans-Mississippi West. The expeditions of Wilkes and Fremont also generated another legacy, the establishment of a geodetic baseline for the trans-Mississippi West. Such a line (at the 40th Parallel) enabled more geodetically accurate surveys, and hence more precise maps.</p>
<p>Wilkes’s exploration of the Pacific Northwest coincided with the nation’s own growing geopolitical interest in the Oregon Country. Indeed, the report of his voyage in 1844 called for the US to immediately gain control of the region in order to counter encroaching British influence in the area. Wilkes’s geographical intelligence also came into play just as US-British negotiations were commencing, and which gave US authorities superb knowledge of the topography and hydrography of the region.</p>`;

  return `<p>In the late 1830s and early 1840s thousands of US settlers began to migrate overland to a region of the Pacific Northwest they called Oregon Country. The migrants brought their sense of national identity, and with it a sense that the region might not always be controlled by British interests or local First Nations. Part of this migration had been facilitated by John C. Fremont, whose expeditions greatly expanded knowledge of the Oregon Trail and the North American interior more generally. In 1846 Senator David Atchison, keen to develop US interests in the Pacific Northwest, asked Fremont to provide him with a map of the Oregon Trail. In response, Fremont’s skilled cartographer, German-born Charles Preuss, set to work and by December had produced a seven-sheet map that featured the topography of the trail as well as extensive information on game, water, rainfall, and the presence of Native peoples.</p>
<p>These seven sheets provided detailed information for actual and armchair migrants alike. Notice the care that Preuss took to include relevant information from Fremont’s Report, such as local climate. This information was still relatively scarce, as average temperature and rainfall maps of the American west would not be accessible until the mid-1850s. Here that information enables the migrant—or the potential migrant—to actually envision himself on the trail, and to understand firsthand the conditions of the overland journey.</p>
<p>Each of the seven sections details not just the topography, but the presence or absence of fuel, game, and water. Preuss also included the map with Fremont’s discussions of Native Americans, and the potential danger that they posed to migrants. With these lengthy asides the Preuss maps capture at least some of the drama of the West. On Section II Fremont describes the “strange emotion of grandeur” that came when the expedition spotted a large herd of bison: “There was not one among us who did not hear his heart beat quicker.”</p>
<p>Section III includes warnings about the harsh conditions of the area, where “no game is to be found” and “Sioux Indians are not to be trusted.” Little surprise then that Fremont advocated a stronger Federal presence and show of force in the Interior West in order to aid the nation’s westward expansion. By the time the maps were printed and distributed in late 1846, much of the area south of the 49th Parallel had come under federal jurisdiction as the nation’s newest territory and its foothold on the Pacific Coast, though further treaties would be negotiated with local First Nations in the decades to follow.</p>`;

  return `<p>This map reflects the intense and sustained effort to improve navigation in Chicago when the city was experiencing rapid growth. Given Chicago’s position as a potential gateway of trade and transportation to the West, it became imperative to maximize the navigability of the river. Yet the contours of the river made this difficult: the mouth of the Chicago River was notoriously hard to navigate because a seventy-yard sandbar inhibited passage to and from Lake Michigan. The depth of the channel at the mouth of the river was at most two feet deep, exacerbated by a sharp bend. To make matters worse, the tides and weather created a sandbar that constantly shifted in size over the course of the year. Ships commonly anchored far into the lake to unload their cargo onto smaller vessels with shallower drafts more capable of successfully navigating the obtrusive channel.</p>
<p>The Federal government began to address this problem as early as 1816, when soldiers at Fort Dearborn were charged with digging channels, but nature rapidly undid their work. Congress appropriated extensive funding in the 1830s to improve the harbor, but with little long-term success. By 1835 the government had a cut channel 200 feet wide and several feet deep across the bar, then added two long piers that extended well into the lake. But sand continued to reappear behind the North Pier.</p>
<p>In April 1854 James Duncan Graham was assigned to direct improvements to the Chicago Harbor. He began with a series of detailed surveys in order to ascertain the necessary changes, and compiled an extensive report supplemented by several maps detailing the proposed construction. Ultimately the work was contracted with the Chicago Dock and Canal Company, which had specific instructions from Graham for excavating the south bank of the river, extending the piers, and constructing a lighthouse at the end of the North Pier.</p>
<p>In his report Graham wrote that the sandbar, however often it was dredged, reformed in almost precisely the same way due to the currents and the position of the north pier. This fact led him to propose a more drastic removal of sand, at an estimated cost of $200,000, nearly four times more than the amount that had been spent to improve the harbor to that point, indicating how much the nation valued easy access between the Erie Canal and the railroad transportation into the interior and across the west. Graham’s map identifies that relationship by marking individual railroads that terminated at the river, just west of its mouth.</p>`;

  return `<p>This map, made by Grenville Mellen Dodge, captures a critical moment in North American history when US ambitions to build a transcontinental railroad directly clashed with Native people’s lives and livelihoods on the high plains. When the Civil War ended in 1865, Dodge was commanding the Department of the Missouri, which was quickly expanded to include several western territories that lay in the path of the railroad. By the summer of 1865 Dodge was made military commander of the Plains, which included Kansas and the territories of Colorado, Utah, Nebraska, Wyoming, and Montana. Dodge set out to map not just the topography of this vast region, but also its military posts, mining districts, and most importantly the ongoing construction of the Union Pacific Railroad.</p>
<p>Given the importance that Dodge attached to the railroad, his priority was to address the threat to its construction posed by Native Americans who opposed US efforts to construct a transcontinental railroad and telegraph. The map refers to this area as the “Military Department of the Platte,” and it indicates the degree to which the federal government—through the army—was critical to the growth of the railroad into the West. Throughout 1866 the military established several forts to protect the Bozeman Trail from Sioux and Cheyenne Indians, including Forts Reno, Kearney, and Smith. But a particularly harsh winter in 1866-1867—coupled with the reduction in forces brought by the end of the Civil War—made it difficult for the military to communicate with and control these forts. Dodge sent soldiers to each of these forts, though attacks by the Sioux led the military to abandon all of them by 1868. Dodge also posted soldiers at depots along the South Platte in order to protect the trail and restore the telegraph line from Omaha to Denver. Here he met with greater success in stabilizing the region for railroad construction. The interest in movement is also apparent in the elaborate tables that list distance for several different overland routes.</p>
<p>In May 1866 Dodge resigned from the military and became the Chief Engineer of the Union Pacific Railroad. Full-scale construction of the road began early in 1866, and this map reveals his engagement with discussions regarding the possible route over the Rocky Mountains. The map was actually completed in January 1866, when Dodge was still in uniform, yet the intelligence was mostly gathered by railroad engineers. In fact, this blurring of the distinction between the aims of the military and those of the railroad is instructive, for the federal government was crucial to the completion of the railroad; whether supplying protection, labor, or the talents of its surveyors such as Dodge, the military and its soldiers were necessary for this massive project to be undertaken. The map was completed in 1866, but extensive annotations were made the following year, many taken from a map made by Christopher Colon Augur, commander of the region from 1867 to 1871.</p>`;

  return `<p>This map captures the rapid expansion of US interests overseas at the turn of the century. The dream of an interoceanic canal was certainly not new to Americans, but for several decades it had focused not on Panama but rather on Nicaragua, a source of tension between the United States and Great Britain particularly in the 1850s. In 1869 the Suez Canal demonstrated the prospects of a canal in the Middle East, and renewed the momentum for another sea-level canal across the American isthmus. Ferdinand de Lesseps, who had so competently supervised the Suez, began to construct a new canal in Panama for French interests. But lack of awareness of the climate and topography led to years of disease and frustrated construction plans. Yellow fever and malaria devastated the workforce at Panama, and heavy rains made the excavation seem virtually impossible. After several years of disease, financial trouble, the French finally gave up on a Panama Canal, which opened the door for advance by the United States. Yet the complex and costly legacy of the French deeply influenced American decisions.</p>
<p>In 1902 the US Senate voted in favor of pursuing a canal in Panama rather than Nicaragua, and subsequently President Roosevelt appointed a seven-member commission to govern its construction. In 1905, the commission appointed a board of engineers to determine whether the canal would be best built at sea level, or through locks. The map here was one of several created by that board—which included both Americans and Europeans—in order to examine the costs, demands, and feasibility of each option. The map identifies the route chosen by Congress in June 1906, based on predictions that it would be safer, easier to enlarge, cheaper to operate, and quicker to construct than to a sea-level canal. The map points to the main features—and challenges—of constructing any type of canal in the area. The entire fifty-mile course of the canal is shown. Notice the identification of the Panama Railroad, which had to be move to accommodate the canal.</p>
<p>The map identifies various sea and canal depths, with navigable water more than forty-one feet deep on the Atlantic side, and more than forty-five feet deep from Gatun Lake to the Pacific Ocean. The prevalence of shallower water, noted in green, and partially explains the persistent problems with mosquitoes faced by French and US canal builders. The information itself was taken from naval charts as well as those from the US Coast and Geodetic Survey, a testament to ongoing federal efforts to map the region for the sake of facilitating movement and communication.</p>`;

<p>The closing months of the Second World War can only be understood as such in hindsight: As 1945 opened it seemed obvious to many that the Pacific War would continue for some time. One piece of evidence of that is this cloth chart of the Korean Peninsula designed for American pilots who might be shot down behind enemy lines.</p>
<p>In early 1943 the Army Air Force informed the Army Map Service (AMS) that it would need 75 to 100 maps specifically designed to aid escape and evasion for its crews in the event of a downed plane. After experimenting with several different materials, the AMS began to produce cloth maps in August 1943, through a private printer. By the end of the war, the AMS had produced 1.6 million of these charts for the Army Air Force alone.</p>
<p>This particular chart is taken from the East Asia series, which began production in early 1944. On one side of the cloth chart is mapped Keijo, while the other centers on Vladivostok, the southeastern edge of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, bordering China and just north of Korea. This map was part of the Eastern Asia series from 1944, though a notation in the lower right corner on the Vladivostok side indicates a much later date of April 1945, just four months before the surrender of Japan. At the time this map was issued, then, the US had successfully invaded the Philippines and waged Battle on Iwo Jima. US forces had begun to land on Okinawa with extensive air and naval support.</p>
<p>Notice the extensive notations on air and sea currents. The sources for the map included US military maps and intelligence as well as Japanese land surveys from the 1930s. The sources for the Vladivostok side of the map are even more extensive. On all the maps, the urgency of up-to-date information is made apparent by the reminder in the lower middle of the map to send corrections and any additional data directly to the Chief of Engineers. Each map includes place names in several languages, and a glossary of terms, presumably to aid American pilots in their efforts to survive and escape. The maps were all designed to include relevant information on both human and natural geography, including various landmarks, towns, railroads, as well as drainage and natural features of the landscape. The legend also includes radio stations, lighthouses, and submarine cables.</p>`;

  return `<p>The Mississippi River Commission was created in 1879 in order to stabilize the river for flood control and navigation. But the 1927 flood demonstrated that existing practices were inadequate, and heightened the urgency of preventing future floods, managing the flow of the river, and stabilizing its banks. The ensuing economic depression of the 1930s generated support for large-scale public works that would advance this end. One of the most notable scientists and engineers in this endeavor was Harold Norman Fisk, a geologist who began to study the Lower Mississippi Valley in his work for the Louisiana Geological Survey. Fisk was fascinated by the prehistoric and modern courses of the river, and experimented with representing this dynamic through maps. In 1941 he convinced the President of the River Commission to support a comprehensive study of the geomorphology of the lower Mississippi River.</p>
<p>Fisk’s colleagues remember him as a demanding leader—even rude and confrontational—but also brilliant. His rigorous two-year study paid off when he produced a massive report with over 100 maps and graphs documenting the complex geological history of the river. He used aerial photographs to search for abandoned channels and patterns of soils, vegetation, and drainage. He also drew on historic maps to chart the course of the river at more recent moments: 1765, 1820, 1880, and 1940. This evidence was combined with extensive fieldwork and prior research in order to reconstruct the evolution of the alluvial plain.</p>
<p>The centerpiece of the report was a set of fifteen maps that each covered a section of the Mississippi River Valley, from Cape Girardeau to Donaldsonville (above New Orleans). At a scale of one inch per mile, the intensely colored maps graphically identify the ever-changing course of the river and the process of sedimentation, both before and since the modern meander belt of the river was formed about 6000 years ago. Each of the shading techniques marks a particular stage in the evolution of the river, including its many cutoffs. This layering effect reconstructed the sequence of events in the long evolution of the river and its valley. The maps are admittedly complex, but they allowed geologists to answer specific questions about the behavior of the river over geologic time as well as recent history. Such information—elegantly and intuitively presented—must have been most welcome in the aftermath of such a devastating flood.</p>
<p>The maps were printed by the Army Map Service during the Second World War, and in fact the War made the river into an important source of transportation, which heightened the attention paid to this research. The report was published in 1944, and it brought Fisk immediate attention and wider latitude to extend his research into related areas. Soon petroleum geologists recognized the implications of his work for oil exploration, particularly the possibility of searching for stratigraphic traps that might contain reserves of oil and gas. In the 1950s he put his skills to work in Houston—with substantial success—yet he continued his geological research throughout that time until he died of leukemia in 1964.</p>`;

  return `<p>This impressive foldout map was affixed to the center of an 1836 report, issued by the Board of Aldermen in New York City, advocating construction of a Great Pier on the North River (an alternate name for the Hudson River, dating to the period of Dutch exploration in the seventeenth century). To educate the public about the need for this enormous structure, the Board commissioned this irregularly shaped map measuring about nine feet long and two feet wide. The map (which has the character of a drawing) shows the juxtaposition of entry points and area streets. Smaller illustrations accompanying the main map offer differing perspectives.</p>
<p>The Board conceived the pier to support the city’s rapid population growth and the rising tide of industrialization that was contributing to a boom in steamship traffic at its wharves. The pier was envisioned for the south end of Manhattan, rather than the area known as Midtown that today is the borough’s transportation hub. Not only was this southerly site more convenient for oceangoing ships, it was directly across the river from the bustling wharves of Jersey City, NJ, from which massive tonnage was floated to Manhattan on a daily basis. New York City’s population at the time of about 300,000, as well as its expanding industries, relied heavily on such cross-river traffic. Jersey City, which had become a railroad terminus in 1834, increased in importance after the opening of the Morris Canal to the rapidly industrializing Passaic River at Newark, NJ, in 1836, the year of this map’s creation.</p>
<p>The Great Pier’s dimensions were staggering for a project of this era. Proposed berthing areas for ships extended from Battery Park on the south to 12th St. on the north, a distance of nearly three miles. The map itself extends further north to 42nd, and the project was envisioned “to extend, in time, from the South Battery, northerly to King’s Bridge,” a distance of nearly fourteen miles, “or at all events as far as the interests of the city shall require.” The fact that this government-sponsored undertaking was even contemplated was extraordinary, considering that many municipal governments at the time were content simply to enforce nuisanced regulations in order to maintain some control over private wharf developments. Estimated to cost $3.4 million—twenty times the annual revenue generated by existing wharves in the city—the Great Pier was not expected to pay for itself for many years.</p>
<p>Construction would have required enormous amounts of raw materials. “The Pier will be constructed with stones, weighing from ¼ of a ton to 4 &amp; 5 tons weight thrown until made level with low water mark,” the report noted. Platforms supported on wooden piles would allow “the flow and ebb tides [to] have free passage, thereby preventing any cause of subsidence or mud deposits. Draw bridges allow for boats to move into the interior portions of the Pier.”</p>
<p>Had the Great Pier been built, the development of Manhattan Island likely would have followed a much different course. By the early 1840s, however, rail service into the middle of Manhattan changed the dynamics of regional transportation and doomed projects of this scope, which could not be justified on the basis of oceangoing traffic alone.</p>`;

  return `<p>Philadelphia’s enormous network of rail lines, as it existed during the 100th anniversary year of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, is vividly shown on this map. Steam-railroad routes, horse-drawn streetcar lines (shown in red), industrial sidings, and spur tracks into the International Exhibition Ground (upper left)—the site of a major event held for the centennial celebrations—all supported a city that was remaking itself in the midst of rapid industrialization.</p>
<p>Rail transportation had so rapidly transformed what was then the United States’ second-largest city that a sizeable share of the local population couldn’t remember a time when there were no trains at all. The region’s oldest rail carrier, the Camden &amp; Amboy Railroad, began operation in 1832, just forty-four years before the map’s publication. From Camden, N.J., this railroad used the ferry link that can be seen crossing the Delaware River in the lower-right portion of the map, employing a short canal that bisected Windmill and Smith’s islands. Considered an impediment to navigation, these islands were removed by the federal government in 1894.</p>
<p>This map is featured in the essay to demonstrate how some of the earliest comprehensive maps of urban transportation networks were produced by private firms seeking to profit from providing travelers a handy resource for navigation. Such maps were updated regularly and thus inevitably doubled as planning documents used by public agencies, real estate developers, and others lacking the resources to prepare maps of their own. This intricate document, included as part of Westcott’s guide book, was made available long before Philadelphia had its own building or zoning department. Several more generations would pass before the city had the resources to undertake a similar effort.</p>
<p>Identification of the International Exhibition Ground’s facilities is among this map’s most notable features. A specially built loop track allowed visitors to detrain only steps away from the Main Building and the Machinery Building, two of the site’s featured venues. The Centennial International Exposition was one of the first large-scale fairs that attracted visitors by rail from a wide geographic region, setting the stage for larger expositions that benefited from the ever-rising speed and convenience of train travel.</p>
<p>Streetcar lines, most of which used horses or small “dummy” steam locomotives for propulsion, were prevalent on downtown streets. Fares on many routes were just $0.07 at the time, or about $1.50 in today’s currency. Many outlying areas were clamoring for streetcar service, setting the stage for a flurry of new construction over the next decade. Although the routes of the city’s steam railroads formed a complex network, they lacked cohesion. As is evident on the map’s index, more than a dozen rail terminals were scattered throughout the city, resulting in enormous duplication and inefficiency.</p>
<p>The famed Main Line of the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR), which linked Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, traverses the upper-left portion of this map. This intensively used corridor is shown with five tracks linking downtown to the northwest side, passing just south of the Exhibition Ground. The forerunner routes of today’s Northeast Corridor are also clearly marked. The Philadelphia–New York portion (top center) is labeled simply as a Connecting Rail Road, while the portion that extends south was the Philadelphia, Wilmington &amp; Baltimore Railroad (bottom of map). Many years passed before these components were assimilated into PRR’s heavily used New York–Washington route, which today is Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor.</p>
<p>The haphazard way in which railroads were spread out haunted Philadelphia for generations. Travelers would have to wait decades for the consolidation of trains into a handful of efficient downtown stations. Moreover, PRR’s Main Line did not yet reach the heart of the city; trains arriving on this route instead ended their runs west of the river. (In 1881, trains began running into Broad Street Station at Broad and Market streets). More than a half-century passed before PRR’s magnificent 30th Street Station (located at 30th and Market Street) opened in 1933, catapulting Philadelphia’s rail service into the modern era and eliminating some of the thorniest of the railroad’s problems. The new station allowed trains to run more efficiently though Philadelphia without the need for complex switching moves.</p>
<p>The massive rail-to-water terminal on the west bank of the Delaware River north of downtown (a facility having the appearance of a rake) illustrates how difficult it was to move traffic between Pennsylvania and New Jersey at the time. Ferries crossing the river were in widespread use until PRR completed its Delair Bridge—the first span of any kind between the two states—near this terminal location in 1896. The presence of this lengthy bridge allowed much economic activity to migrate to the New Jersey side of the metropolitan region.</p>`;

  return `<p>The topography, streets, railroad lines and terminals of the New York City region are shown in magnificent detail in this large-format 1895 map. The prominence of steam railroads is evident in the bold lines denoting their routes, which grab the reader’s attention more than the thinly drawn rapid-transit lines, which were still in various phases of development. The uneven quality of roads is emphasized by Rand McNally’s note that this is a map “With the good roads specially marked.” </p>
<p>Grand Central Depot, predecessor of today’s famous Grand Central Terminal, was the endpoint of the only direct conventional rail line into Midtown Manhattan. The existence of this line bestowed enormous market power on the New York Central Railroad, but competition was fierce among elevated rapid-transit (“El”) companies on many routes within the city. The El crossed the Brooklyn Bridge and fanned out through Brooklyn. Trains on these lines, while catalysts for development, primarily used steam propulsion, generating a great deal of smoke and soot. </p>
<p>This is the only map featured in this essay that was created primarily to assist in the navigation of travelers on all modes of travel over a large region. Even so, such maps were heavily used by government officials exploring options to improve transportation. This map illustrates the proliferation of rail terminals along the New Jersey shoreline of the Hudson River, with particularly large facilities (from south to north) at Jersey City, Hoboken, and Weehawken. The crisscrossing configuration of the routes and density of train operations led to significant chaos and commotion along the waterfront. On the opposite side of Manhattan Island, the tracks of the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR), a Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) subsidiary, can be seen terminating along the East River at Hunter’s Point, thereby requiring passengers to make burdensome ferry transfers to reach Manhattan. </p>
<p>In no other major city in America (except perhaps San Francisco) did waterways present such vexing geographical challenges to the railroads. With tunnels and bridges to central Manhattan still years away, ferry service was of paramount importance for both passengers and freight. Another fifteen years passed after this map’s publication before PRR finished tunneling under the Hudson and East rivers and opened the new Pennsylvania Station in 1910, providing its passengers and those of the affiliated LIRR with a magnificent new gateway into Midtown. To this day, however, the tunneling process is arguably incomplete: Swarms of commuters bound for Manhattan from New Jersey still ride trains to the Hudson shoreline and transfer to buses, ferries, or connecting trains. </p>
<p>The limited extent of the street grid in outlying regions vividly illustrates just how much more growth would take place. Flushing, NY, (upper right) was only lightly developed at the time, but would be absorbed into the city in 1898. Portions of Brooklyn remained pastoral, despite their proximity to El lines, which were mostly newly built at the time. Huge swaths of land immediately southwest of Newark and on Long Island remained untouched by development. A housing boom in Queens would occur after the opening of the Queensboro Bridge (originally Blackwell’s Island Bridge) in 1909. This massive cantilever span handled both vehicles and transit lines. </p>
<p>The red line denotes the boundaries of what was considered Greater New York at the time. This area seems miniscule in comparison to what is now considered metropolitan New York. The region had only about five million people at the time, less than a third of today’s population. </p>`;

  return `<p>The six major rail-passenger stations of downtown Chicago—all storied parts of American railroad history—appear in colorful detail along with other terminals on this well-preserved map. These stations—Central (lower left); Dearborn (center left); Van Buren Street (center, later renamed LaSalle Street Station); Grand Central (upper center); Union Passenger Station (upper center, later replaced by Union Station); and Wells Street Station (upper right)—were likened by developer Charles Nichols to “mouths that fed the city” (Chicago Real Estate Board 1923, 11-12). </p>
<p>The Chicago Terminal Transfer Railroad Co., which created this map, did not miss the opportunity to showcase its own station, Grand Central. The reader’s eye inevitably focuses on the drawings of Grand Central’s awe-inspiring train shed—at one time the largest in the United States—and the massive “head house” with its decorative clock tower. The production of this map—one of just two commissioned by private transportation companies featured in this essay—was motivated by a desire to demonstrate to investors the enormity of the company’s yards and real estate holdings in this part of Chicago. </p>
<p>The map is remarkable for its intricate depiction not only of mainline tracks, but of side tracks, spurs, freight yards, and wharves. Not only does it show the precise configuration of tracks at the heart of one of the world’s busiest rail hubs, it uses a color-coding system explaining which tracks, yards, wharves, and ancillary facilities were associated with each railroad. The green-shaded area, for example, depicts the facilities of the Illinois Central in the vicinity of Central Station—the grand depot near the shoreline that opened just before the celebrated Columbian Exposition of 1893. Yellow shading depicts the facilities of the Chicago &amp; North Western Railroad (C&amp;NW), while brown shading depicts the property of the Pennsylvania Railroad. </p>
<p>Such a dense network of railroad lines presented enormous challenges to city planners. Many travelers, especially the elderly and those toting heavy luggage, were loath to transfer between the city’s terminals. Rarely was making transfers between stations as simple as taking the “L” (elevated train). A seemingly endless procession of railroad tracks crossed 12th St. between Michigan Ave. and Canal St., creating a major impediment to proponents of the “City Beautiful Movement” seeking to clear up areas around the downtown core. </p>
<p>The timing of this map—issued during the Columbian Exposition—makes it especially valuable. Massive public-improvement projects would gradually gain momentum over the next several years. By the turn of the twentieth century, the South Branch of the Chicago River had been straightened, the flow of the river system was reversed (away from Lake Michigan), and new parkland was created east of the Illinois Central tracks along the lakefront (later becoming Grant Park and, more recently, Millennium Park). Later, 12th Street was raised on a viaduct to reduce the interference created by trains operating from the downtown stations. </p>
<p>Efforts to consolidate the terminals, however, were repeatedly stymied by issues of complexity and cost. Nothing came of Daniel Burnham and Edward Bennett’s recommendation in their famed 1909 <em>Plan of Chicago</em> that passenger-train operations be consolidated into just one or two major terminals. Not only was such a grand vision never realized, but more modest efforts, such as proposals to close Grand Central and shift its trains to other stations, never came to be. </p>
<p>Several milestones were nonetheless achieved after this map was published. In 1911, Chicago &amp; North Western replaced its old Wells Street Station (the site of today’s Merchandise Mart) with its massive North Western Terminal on Madison St. A “new” Union Station, much of which was designed by Burnham &amp; Co., opened in 1923, replacing the older depot of the same name. </p>
<p>After the Second World War, transportation planners studied the possibility of replacing Central, Dearborn, Grand Central, and LaSalle stations with a new twenty-track depot on the site of Central Station. These efforts and others failed, and the consolidation movement was left dead in its tracks. Chicago remained a six-station town for more than sixty years after this map was produced. Apart from the replaced Wells Street Station, Grand Central was first to close, seeing its last train in 1969 before being torn down in 1971. </p>
<p>The historic “Greater Loop” district of Chicago remains an exciting place to experience big-city railroading. LaSalle, North Western Terminal (now the Ogilvie Transportation Center), and Union Station are still busy places, although each has been substantially modified. Among the smaller stations shown on this map, Water Street Station (upper right) has been replaced by today’s ultra-modern Millennium Station. Although all long-distance trains serving Chicago have used Union Station since 1972, Burnham and Bennett’s dream of consolidating the city’s passenger trains into one or two central hubs was never fulfilled. </p>`;

  return `<p>This intricate map, which was included in the Southern Pacific Railroad’s 1911 Annual Report, shows the Pacific Electric Railway (PE) at a momentous point in its history, the year the “Great Merger” transformed the carrier into a regional transportation powerhouse. Orchestrated by Southern Pacific (SP), which owned Pacific Electric, the merger brought several lines in the Los Angeles area into the PE fold. Pacific Electric thus became the largest interurban electric railway in the world, boasting more than 1,000 miles of track. </p>
<p>The newly enlarged Pacific Electric was integral to the economic health of the region over the next decade and was held in high regard by the populace. This was in spite of the notoriety of its owner, Southern Pacific, for alleged monopolistic practices throughout California. Investors looked with buoyant optimism at the profit-making potential of “clean and efficient” interurban railways such as Pacific Electric. PE’s brightly painted “Red Cars,” which provided comfortable, frequent, and affordable service to the working class, vastly improved citizen mobility in the region. </p>
<p>This map is included in the essay to show the manner in which privately-operated transit providers like the Pacific Electric used maps to amplify their importance to the metropolitan area. Interurban railways sought to demonstrate how they shared with public officials a desire to expand rail transportation systems to promote development on the urban fringe. Had this map been intended entirely for navigation purposes, a much more detailed presentation about intermediate stops and transfer points would have been included. Instead, this map is designed to both impress upon officials and investors why Pacific Electric’s fortunes were tied to the fate of the Los Angeles region and how its trains could take one almost anywhere in the region. </p>
<p>Among the most remarkable qualities of this map are its accurate portrayal of how Pacific Electric lines threaded their way through cities and its inclusion of the lines of parent company Southern Pacific. A careful study of the map shows that these carriers crossed each other at dozens of locations. The map also shows Pacific Electric’s enormous track capacity. Not only are many routes “double track,” (i.e., equipped with two tracks), allowing trains to pass each other without stopping, but two lines—those extending northeast from downtown Los Angeles to El Molino and south to Watts—had four tracks, a rarity among interurban railways. In Long Beach and Santa Monica, Pacific Electric provided the equivalent of local streetcar service, as can be seen by the multiplicity of routes in these cities. </p>
<p>The map also shows Port Los Angeles (upper left), a massive privately financed wharf under construction at the time. Southern Pacific envisioned Port Los Angeles diverting a great deal of marine tonnage from San Pedro (lower left), but within a few years of this map’s publication the Port was considered a failure. The zigzagging line up Mount Lowe (upper center) also stands out. While heavily romanticized for its curvy route offering spectacular vistas along a perilous climb up the mountains, it was eventually doomed by mudslides. </p>
<p>Despite the merger, large gaps remained in the Pacific Electric system. Another three years would pass before Pacific Electric covered the entire sixty-mile distance between Los Angeles and San Bernardino. The routes in Pomona and Riverside also remained isolated from the rest of the system. These gaps were filled by 1925, when the carrier’s network reached its maximum extent. </p>
<p>The next twenty years were tough times for Pacific Electric. One by one, its routes were abandoned or reduced to “freight only” status. The last passenger service on a former Pacific Electric line ended in 1961. Transit users in Los Angeles frequently bemoan the demise of this once-great system. The successful development of a light-rail system in the region, however, was made possible partially by the prevalence of former Pacific Electric rights-of-way. Starting in 1993, the historic route between downtown and Long Beach gradually reemerged as the Metro Blue Line. Portions of the former PE line between the point on the map denoted as Amoco and Santa Monica, via Home Junction, opened as the Metro Gold Line in 2012. A “Subway to the Sea” is being considered along the former Hollywood-Beverly Hills-Santa Monica corridor. Without doubt, electric railroading in Los Angeles is in the midst of a revival. </p>`;

  return `<p>The map, prepared by the New England Regional Planning Commission in 1937, is a testament to the enthusiasm behind the regional planning movement prior to the start of the Second World War. This movement was built around the idea that planning for flood control, parks, housing, and transportation should not be shackled by the historical boundaries of communities. Instead, the movement promoted clusters of communities, and even clusters of states, charting a shared future to optimize the value of public investments. </p>
<p>In this spirit of regional planning, state lines are barely visible on the map. It showcases lofty ideas contemplated by planners to improve parkland and transportation, some of which were at odds with the stark budgetary realities prevalent during the lingering Great Depression. Another problem was that most regional planning agencies had little actual power and depended on voluntary action by local governments. The federal government still played a minor role in addressing most public-works problems. </p>
<p>This map’s subtitle, “Indicating Progress of Planning in New England,” captures the sense of momentum felt by advocates at the time. Smaller text notes that the plans summarized on the map were created by the region’s state planning boards, which were staffed by influential individuals who could push governments in the desired direction. </p>
<p>Careful study of this map will reveal that, in sharp contrast to earlier transportation maps, railroad lines are omitted. Prominent instead are proposed regional and “limited way” highways and “parkways” (several of which were under construction at the time) allowing motorists to savor the region’s natural beauty. Note especially the “Coastal Limited Way” road (denoted by a red line with a dash-dot-dash pattern) envisioned for fast automobile travel roughly parallel to the coast. Highways of this kind were stated to be limited-access roads similar to the famous German Autobahns that captured the public’s imagination during the 1930s. </p>
<p>Significantly, the proposed Coastal Limited Way route bypassed Boston and followed a path through outlying Worcester—clear evidence of the priorities that would later shape the construction of the Interstate Highway System. Much of this proposed route was eventually followed by Interstate 95. Other proposed highways linked densely populated cities with areas identified for acquisition as national forests, particularly in the northern part of the region. Such bold plans reflected the perceived synergy between the conservation movement and transportation planning at the time. </p>
<p>Airline routes (thick black lines) are also notable for their inclusion in a government-issued map, a rarity today. As with expressways, governments felt a need not only to build airports, but to support the development of intercity air services. Much of northern New England’s airline mileage at the time was operated by companies owned by the region’s railroads, an arrangement that ended during the Second World War. A portion of the recently established Trans-Canada Airway extends across the top of the map. Within a decade, air travel would be seen as too prolific and commonplace to warrant inclusion on such maps. </p>
<p>Another novelty of this map is the inclusion of facilities for seaplanes—versatile aircraft that can take off and alight on water. For a short period in the 1930s, there was feverish optimism that seaplanes and larger “flying boats” would provide a permanent solution to the need to shuttle passengers between congested coastal areas and municipal airports. Indeed, in the year of this map’s publication, officials broke ground at New York Municipal (LaGuardia) Airport on the grandest seaplane terminal of them all, the Marine Air Terminal, envisioned as the eastern terminus of a short-lived transatlantic flying boat service. </p>
<p>Optimism behind the regional planning movement faded during the Second World War. Just four years after this map was produced, war came to region’s doorstep as German U-Boats prowled the coastline. Gasoline shortages became endemic. Expressway projects remained shelved even after the war ended, and state planning boards gradually surrendered their clout to metropolitan planning organizations, which were set up to administer ever-increasing amounts of federal funds dispensed to state and local governments. </p>`;

  return `<p>This map offers a powerful visualization of the ambitious transportation and land-use plans developed by the Chicago Plan Commission for the city in 1946. This blue-ribbon panel, nominally independent from the city government, had a tradition of thinking big—a direct legacy of Daniel Burnham and Edward Bennett’s famed 1909 <em>Plan of Chicago</em>, which led to the Commission’s creation. The Commission sought to modernize the city’s worn-out infrastructure and prepare for residential development anticipated to push the city’s population from about 3.5 million in 1946 to 3.8 million by 1965. </p>
<p>This attractive work of cartography might be regarded as the climax in the Commission’s technical map production. The colored shading illustrates the neighborhood land uses in remarkable detail, with much of the information derived from an exhaustive Works Progress Administration survey completed in 1940. Residential land use, for example, is shown in yellow and commercial areas are in purple. Parks, both existing and projected, are shown in green. Proposed expressways and land needed for newly built interchanges are also depicted. </p>
<p>Brown shading depicts the enormous footprint of Chicago’s heavy industry. The Windy City was the country’s largest manufacturing center at the time, but few recognized that much of this industrial land would gradually be abandoned. Over time, such de-industrialization would greatly change the character of Chicago. South of the Loop District, many of the railroad yards and freight terminals became superfluous by the late 1960s. The ability to use this blighted property for apartment, condominium, and town house development was instrumental to downtown Chicago’s resurgence in the early 1990s, which infused new vitality into the city’s central area. </p>
<p>The patchwork quilt of railroad lines and rapid-transit routes shown on this map had been a familiar part of Chicago for many years, but, tellingly, they are given less emphasis than highways. This was likely a manifestation of the belief that improved roads for buses, cars, and trucks were more important to the city’s future than rail lines, as well as the view that rail services would remain mostly self-sustaining without government support. </p>
<p>Proposed locations for urban renewal projects, which would completely transform much of the city over the next quarter-century, particularly on the South and West sides, are notable for their absence on the map. By the mid-1950s, federal support for such housing projects had grown so dramatically that they were a dominant feature of many long-range plans. </p>
<p>The brown numbers on the map denote various community areas within the city. Within a few years after this map’s publication, the number of community areas increased substantially following Chicago’s annexation of land on the Southwest and Northwest sides of the city. New property within the city on Southwest side set the stage for thousands of new single-family housing units, while the Northwest side was developed for O’Hare International Airport. Curiously, the map provides no indication of O’Hare’s impending construction, even though the decision to build this major airport had already been made. </p>
<p>The expressway grid shown crisscrossing the city—perhaps this map’s most intriguing feature—was envisioned to place a modern freeway within a few minutes of almost the entire population. Some of these expressways (shown in orange) were slated to be limited-access roads, much like today’s Interstate Highways, but others were to be more modestly designed, perhaps lacking median strips and with occasional stoplights to lessen the need for bridges and overpasses. The concept was in flux, however, and the highways’ projected routes varied from year to year as planners grappled with difficult issues of business and residential expropriation and relocation. </p>
<p>The Commission was correct to anticipate that Chicago’s population would grow after the war, but it was wrong about key details. First, few anticipated that such a high proportion of the growth would be concentrated in high-rise buildings and other new housing stock along the North Lakefront region, created many vexing zoning and parking issues. Second, few anticipated that many other neighborhoods would soon suffer devastating population losses. The city’s population is believed to have reached its peak in 1953. By the late 1950s, significant parts of South and West sides were experiencing an exodus of white middle-class populations. </p>
<p>Nor did the Commission recognize how difficult expressway construction would be. Only about half of the mileage shown on this map was built over the next twenty years. (Outer Drive, now known as Lake Shore Drive, was partially open by the time of this map’s production). The Edens Expressway (listed as the “North Branch of the Northwest Route,” at the upper center) opened in 1951. Today’s Dan Ryan, Eisenhower, and Kennedy expressways, which converge near downtown, were opened by the early 1960s on somewhat different routes than those shown here. The Southwest Expressway (today’s Stevenson Expressway) opened in 1964 on a route quite similar to that shown here. </p>
<p>The effort to build the remaining expressway grid eventually languished, despite being identified as a high priority in the Chicago Area Transportation Study of 1963. Almost all hope for building these supplemental expressways dissipated when Mayor Richard J. Daley dropped his plans to construct the controversial Crosstown Expressway—a north-south spine through the West Side (appearing on this map as the north-south route passing through Cicero)—in the 1970s due to fierce neighborhood opposition. As a result, Chicago was left with a radially oriented system of expressways that emanate from the downtown district. Today it suffers some of the country’s worst traffic congestion. Partially because of the inadequacies of its expressways, however, the Windy City’s commuter rail and rapid-transit systems are among the most heavily used in the country. </p>`;

  return `<p>This map, created for Valparaiso’s master plan in 1951, illustrates the stark reality facing leaders of this small Indiana city: The necessity of preparing for changes resulting from the gradual encroachment of metropolitan Chicago, the hulking neighbor to the northwest, and to continue to be a provider of services to the fertile agricultural areas to the east and south. The ever-diminishing gap between Valparaiso and metropolitan Chicago made it imperative that Valparaiso look beyond its boundaries. </p>
<p>A community of 12,000 at the time, and the seat of Porter County, Valparaiso can be seen faintly circled in red on the lower right portion of the map. This circle depicts the approximate zone in which the community had legal jurisdiction over planning decisions. Development outside of this ring remained largely beyond the city’s control. Much of the area east of Valparaiso was farmland. </p>
<p>The map delivers on its claim “to show the geographic relationships of Valparaiso to natural features, urban communities, and chief transportation routes of the Calumet-Chicago region.” Thin red lines representing railroads depict Valparaiso’s strategic location on the region’s rail network, at the convergence of the Grand Trunk Western (GTW), Nickel Plate Road, and Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR). These routes were bustling freight and passenger corridors that traversed the territory south of Lake Michigan and terminated in the Windy City. By virtue of being situated on the powerful Pennsylvania Railroad, Valparaiso had direct and relatively fast access to the East Coast. US Route 30, the famed Lincoln Highway, also cut through the middle of town. </p>
<p>Within a decade of this map’s production Valparaiso experienced enormous growth. Workers previously living in older, deteriorating neighborhoods in Gary and other shoreline communities (top left) flocked to pleasant “green grass” sites around Valparaiso. More growth occurred after the development of Burns Harbor, situated beside the lake northwest of Valparaiso. This area became the site of a major Bethlehem Steel plant and the newly incorporated town of Burns Harbor in the late 1960s. The area between the two communities was ecologically diverse, consisting of both the Glacial Lake Chicago Plain (shown in white on the map) and the beach-dune deposits along the lake’s shoreline. </p>
<p>As growth accelerated, Valparaiso also looked ahead to the development of scheduled airline service. The small Porter County Airport, shown on the map immediately east of the community, had intermittent service starting in the mid-1950s. Hopes ran high for a breakthrough in air-service development when Phillips Airlines began four daily “air taxi” roundtrips to Chicago’s O’Hare Airport in 1969. </p>
<p>The transportation industry, however, gradually turned its back on Valparaiso. The community was bypassed by Interstate highways, which brought enormous growth to Merrillville, Ind., a town so small that it is not even shown on this map (it is located midway between Valparaiso and Crown Point, left of center). As recently as the late 1960s, two of the three railroads (GTW and PRR successor Penn Central) and Greyhound offered long-distance passenger service to Valparaiso. By the late 1980s only Amtrak and Greyhound remained, and by the mid-1990s both of these carriers had exited as well. Scheduled airline services were dropped in 1986. In only twenty years, Valparaiso went from being a transportation success story to a city with no long-distance service provided by air, bus, or rail. It was the only community in the metropolitan Chicago region with this dubious distinction. Budget cuts also spelled doom for commuter trains to Chicago. </p>
<p>In spite of these setbacks, Valparaiso continued to grow rapidly. The expansion of metropolitan Chicago spilled into Porter County, making Valparaiso an important employment center. Today, Valparaiso has 31,000 residents, and its population will likely exceed 40,000 within a decade. Moreover, a comeback in rail transportation may be in the offing. The former Grand Trunk Western line has been identified for the possible restoration of commuter rail service to Chicago. Rail advocates also envision high-speed trains operating over the former PRR route. Intercity buses have returned. Much as planners had anticipated in 1951, Valparaiso’s future increasingly rests on the future of the metropolitan Chicago. </p>`;

  return `<p>This map illustrates the enormous planning that went into civilian evacuation of urban areas in the event of nuclear attack at the height of the Cold War. Issued by the New Orleans Office of Civil Defense, the text makes little attempt underplay the danger. Readers are urged to “Know what you should do, know why you should do it, know when you should do it.” An outline of a nuclear mushroom cloud on the reverse side of the map offers power visual imagery, reminding residents of the need to study the map in advance. </p>
<p>Arrows on the map point to the arterial roadways deemed best suited for fast evacuation. At first blush, these arrows resemble the movements of a Second World War tank division through a European city more than a route for civilians traveling by bicycle, car, or on foot. In some cases, residents were given considerable discretion, perhaps with the hope they wouldn’t all try to use the same roads. Most residents were directed east or west, in part due to the limited capacity of the only two Mississippi River bridges—the same two crossings that exist today. Residents near Lake Pontchartrain were directed to the lightly used terminal of New Orleans’ Lakefront Airport, which was being retrofitted as a concrete-walled bomb shelter at about the same period this map was produced (Most commercial air traffic had been moved to a newer airport closer to the edge of town, today’s Louis Armstrong International). </p>
<p>The reverse side of the map offers many references to the hoped-for speed with which the exodus would take place. Readers are advised that “Motor transportation will be your salvation,” and to “Keep no less than ½ tank of gas at any time. If a vehicle breaks down, push it off the road and abandon it.” </p>
<p>Nor are motorists led to believe that a nuclear blast will affect only a narrowly defined area. “It must be realized that it is not enough just for you to get outside the twenty-mile zone. You must keep going so that the people behind you can get out also,” the narrative warns. Indeed, the Soviet Union had upgraded from atomic to much more powerful hydrogen bombs six years earlier, and was in the midst of dramatic improvements to its intercontinental missiles at the time. Some residents no doubt cringed upon reading that that they should take heed of the “Take Cover Signal,” described as being “Warbling or intermittent 3 to 5 minute blasts on streets.” </p>
<p>New Civil Defense maps were issued for the city approximately once a year to reflect enhancements to evacuation plans. In 1963, about two years after this map was issued, security rose to maximal levels during the Cuban Missile Crisis. New Orleans was 669 miles from Havana, putting it out of range of short-range missiles, but it was an important strategic target nonetheless. By the mid-1970s, however, such maps were rarely issued to the general public. </p>
<p>Forty-four years after this map was issued, Hurricane Katrina brought notoriety to the enormous logistical difficulties of quickly moving large numbers of people out of New Orleans. Present-day plans for evacuation during hurricane season take on almost the same urgency as those during the Cold War. Such weather-induced plans, however, allow for the city to be emptied over a time period extending over days rather than mere hours. </p>`;

  return `<p>This fascinating portrayal of the ambitious mass-transit projects being contemplated in New York City in the late 1960s points to the renewed emphasis on rail service after a long period in which highway construction had been given priority. Optimism about government’s ability to embark on several projects simultaneously was sustained by the tremendous progress being made building Interstate highways at the time, by expanded federal support for transportation projects, and by the rising sophistication of the transportation-planning community. </p>
<p>The timing of this map, which was issued by the City Planning Commission in 1969, makes it illustrative of the public mood during a turbulent political period. Governments everywhere were growing weary of public protests, including ever-increasing “expressway revolt.” In New York, plans to build the Mid-Manhattan Expressway across Manhattan to 30th Street were rapidly falling out of favor. This proposed elevated expressway, requiring relocation of nearly 2,000 families and 804 businesses, evoked a strong negative public response, despite having been championed for years by influential leaders such as Robert Moses, New York City Parks Commissioner and Arterial Coordinator, who had proposed it in 1949. The proposed Lower Manhattan Expressway, slated to link Midtown to Brooklyn, was also shelved as planners, under pressure from citizens, began to look more sympathetically at the impacts of highway construction on neighborhoods. </p>
<p>The comments made on this map make it clear that New York City sought a balanced transportation system. Captions emphasize that planners were not assuming that one mode of transportation was better than another, and that they would instead conduct analyses to determine this. Nevertheless, the penchant of planners in the city for grandiose projects still stands out. The thick red lines denote an entire network of proposed rapid transit routes. A map notation states “as the growth of Staten Island continues, improved access to Manhattan will permit exploiting the potential of the island” with a “Staten Island–Manhattan Tunnel.” Whether this would be a rail or highway tunnel is not specified, but the fact that it appears on a mass-transit map suggests that rail service was a distinct possibility. A new corridor was also envisioned between Midtown and New Jersey—another enormously costly undertaking. </p>
<p>Improved service to growing residential neighborhoods in Queens was a major priority, both in the form of a new commuter rail line and a “Super Express” rapid-transit line across the East River. Planners also anticipated building a 2nd Avenue Rapid Transit (subway) line to fill the void left by demolition of the elevated line on that road several decades earlier. For airline passengers heading from Manhattan to Long Island airport terminals and frustrated by road congestion and the paucity of transit service, relief was to come in the form of new highway links to LaGuardia Airport and an entirely new rail line to John F. Kennedy International Airport (lower right). </p>
<p>By the early 1970s, much of the momentum behind these ambitious proposals had been lost. The city began losing its population at an alarming rate, and by the end of the decade was more than 10% smaller than when the decade began. Across the country, comprehensive plans such as this one came to be seen as products of a bygone era due to community opposition and growing financial constraints. Work on the 2nd Avenue subway was halted in 1972. Eight years after the plan was issued, the New York City government was broke. By the early 1980s, the federal government had dramatically reduced its support for far-flung urban transportation initiatives. </p>
<p>By the late 1980s, however, and to the surprise of many, the city had orchestrated an impressive turnaround. A Wall Street boom, more business-friendly policies adopted by the city, and a growing interest in urban lifestyles reawakened the spirit of the 1969 plan. A rail-transit line was built as planned to the perimeter of Kennedy Airport and improved express subway service was instituted to Queens. Work is now underway on both expanded rail access between Midtown Manhattan and New Jersey as well as on the 2nd Avenue Subway, which is projected to be completed by 2018. </p>`;

  return `<p>Don Bernardo de Miera y Pacheco (1713-1785) was an accomplished explorer and skilled cartographer and a captain in the Spanish Royal Corps of Engineers, founded by a royal decree of Felipe V of the new Spanish Bourbon Dynasty in 1711 to help rebuild his war-torn empire. These soldier-engineers were to be well schooled in mathematics, field astronomy, and map making. The Corps came to represent what was understood as scientific mapping, and in northern New Spain engineers such as Miera were adjunct to presidios and other military forces on the frontier. They surveyed geographical details that could be observed directly and more and more came to discount local hearsay information; they also were the first accurately to map the roads of the American West. The tradition they established was built upon and advanced by Mexican and US soldier-engineers throughout the nineteenth century. </p>
<p>The principle purpose of the Dominguez-Escalante Expedition was to find a way, what would become the Old Spanish Trail, between Santa Fe and Monterey in Alta California. They penetrated west through what is now New Mexico and Colorado into Utah to Laguna de los Timpanangos (Utah Lake), before being forced south into Arizona by a massive blizzard and a shortage of food and supplies and then back to Santa Fe, traveling a total of more than 1,800 miles. Miera’s map incorporates the geographical and anthropological data from the expedition with what the Spanish already knew about these lands and as such is one of the most important maps of the American West and is an important source for the later maps of New Spain by Alexander von Humboldt and Zebulon Montgomery Pike, among others. It shows many of the discoveries made by the fathers and Miera, including Laguna Miera (Lake Sevier) in Arizona, and uses crosses on circles to mark the daily progress of the expedition. It also offers the first European depiction of the Upper Colorado River Basin and the lakes and streams of the eastern Great Basin. </p>
<p>This map is a later copy of the original map completed by Miera in 1777 that was sent with Escalante’s <em>Diario Derrotero</em> of the expedition to the viceroy of New Spain in Mexico City. Miera also prepared a report, detailing his recommendations for the placement of future presidios to combat the Indian threat to Western New Mexico. The originals of both maps are in the British Library, and The Newberry Library has photographic copies in its Karpinski Collection. Louis C. Karpinski (1878-1956) was a professor of mathematics at the University of Michigan and an enthusiastic student of North American cartography. While on leave, in 1926 he photographed more than 700 American-related maps in European archives, about 180 of them Spanish and four by Miera. He produced six sets of fine eleven-by-seventeen-inch black-and-white prints of these maps and donated them to six American research libraries, among them The Newberry Library, to make them more readily available to map researchers. </p>`;

  return `<p>Friedrich Wilhelm Heinrich Alexander Freiherr von Humboldt (1769-1859) was a polymath, a dominant virtuoso intellectual—naturalist, geographer, explorer, philosopher, diplomat, and author—and a transitional figure of the later Enlightenment and early Romantic eras. In 1799-1804, Humboldt, armed with royal permits from the otherwise secretive Spanish, explored, researched, and collected specimens in the lands of Venezuela, the Oronoco River Basin, Cuba, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Mexico. Some the findings of this extensive journey were detailed in Humboldt’s <em>Essai Politique sur Royaume de Nouvelle Espagne…,</em> published in Paris in 1809 and London in 1810. Accompanying this account was an atlas of finely engraved relevant maps by Humboldt, including a major map of New Spain and this one of El Camino Real, which is actually a detail of the New Spain map. He did not actually explore northern New Spain, so these maps were in part based on research done in Paris, Madrid, Seville, Mexico City (where he probably encountered Bernardo de Miera y Pacheco’s cartography), and elsewhere. </p>
<p>This is the first thoroughly detailed, widely disseminated printed map of the eastern branch of this main road system of the early American West. The route is detailed in three segments, from Santa Fe south to Chihuahua, Chihuahua to Durango, and Durango to Mexico City respectively. Reminiscent of the Spanish derroterros, which were its principle sources, it depicts only the surveyed road and its immediate environs. From this map it is clear that the route was significantly governed by the availability of water. Thus, north of Paseo del Norte (present-day El Paso-Juarez) the road essentially followed the Rio Grande Valley to Santa Fe. Several lakes too are prominently indicated all along the way. Mountains, mesas, and other particularly difficult terrains are circumvented where possible. Mexican and Indian pueblos on the itinerary are specified. And in Mexico, connecting east-west arteries are shown. </p>
<p>Humboldt’s cartography had a significant impact on the later mapping of the American West. For example, on his way back to Europe he stopped off in Washington, DC and left a manuscript copy of his New Spain map with his friend President Thomas Jefferson. The information on this map was made available to Lieutenant Zebulon Montgomery Pike in preparation for his tour of exploration into the southern Louisiana Purchase in 1806-1807 and appeared on Pike’s own crucial map of New Spain, published in Philadelphia in 1810. Since Pike had explored much of northern New Spain, his map was partially more accurate than Humboldt’s. Both helped to further open up the West, and Humboldt’s maps, especially this one of El Camino Real, were still respected and of value to the American military almost four decades later at the time of the Mexican-American War. </p>`;

Mitchell likewise specialized in meeting the growing demand for geographical information about the West with high quality, mass market lithographed maps such as this one of his masterpieces.

As it states in its extended title, this map is “compiled from the most recent authorities,” such as the cartography of Lewis and Clark, Zebulon Pike, John C. Frémont, William H. Emory, among others. It was both popular and influential because of what it said about the West to an increasing and eager viewership. While working as a teacher Mitchell had found himself frustrated by the lack of good maps in the classroom.

  return `<p>For some years after Columbus crossed the Atlantic Ocean, in 1492, Spanish activity in the New World was confined to the area of the Caribbean Sea. But then, after the discovery of the immense riches of Mexico in 1519, there began a feverish period during which Spanish leaders intensively explored other parts of the New World, hoping to find wealth to compare with that of central America. In this, they were spectacularly successful in South America, though not in the region north of Mexico. This period of expansion was accompanied by a burst of mapping, which attempted to record the Spaniards’ newfound lands. </p>
<p>This map by Domingo del Castillo (originally manuscript) dated from that time (1541), though this printed copy may be found in the <em>Historia de la Nueva-España</em> published at Mexico City in 1770. That town (“La ciudad de Mexico”) may be seen at the lower right, quite far from its true location. It counterbalances “La ciudad de Cibola” at the upper left; this was the legendary if imaginary city of Cibola, a rich prize which the Spaniards spent much time and money pursuing, in vain. Castillo, who compiled the map during the expedition of Alarcón (1540-1542), was a pilot while the expedition thoroughly investigated the coastline, and sailed twice up the Colorado River (top left). </p>
<p>Baja California is correctly shown as a peninsula, though it would thereafter often be shown as an island, and the abundance of place-names on the east coast of the Gulf of California—very few of which survive—shows that the Spaniards were in the process of settling this area, for which they had what turned out to be unrealistically high expectations. What we now call the “Pacific Ocean” was then known as the “Mar del Sur,” because it had first been identified by Vasco Nuñez de Balboa (c. 1475-1517) as he looked southwards from the Isthmus of Panama. </p>
<p>Castillo inserts figures for latitude down the left margin, and these have stood the test of time. In the absence of any way of calculating the time elapsed from the start of the voyage (a weakness eventually corrected by the advent of marine chronometers), chartmakers of his day were not able accurately to calculate figures of longitude (the east-westerly direction). This weakness would for many years reduce the precision of maps produced by European explorers. </p>`;

Alvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca (c. 1485-c. 1559) led an expedition there between 1528 and 1536, and this was followed by the expedition of Hernando de Soto (1496-1542), which ranged over vast distances between 1539 and 1543. The De Soto expedition generated a particularly full manuscript map of the huge area covered, and this map then became the source for the printed map of the area found in the 1584 edition of Abraham Ortelius’s great atlas, the <em>Theatrum Orbis Terrarum</em>. </p>
<p>Our map draws from these precursors, as well as others, and is the work of “a public servant with an interest in geography,” as R.A. Skelton puts it. Wytfliet had compiled an atlas of nineteen maps showing various parts of the New World, oddly titling it as an addition to the works of Ptolemy. There is no evidence that Wytfliet had access to any unpublished information; he simply relied on the standard and readily available printed works. His atlas thus resembled other collections of maps and texts of the late sixteenth century by enterprising entrepreneurs like Giovanni Battista Ramusio, Theodor de Bry, and Richard Hakluyt. </p>
<p>The original manuscript map by Alonso de Santa Cruz had shown a great variety of more or less fanciful rivers emptying into the Gulf of Mexico; it also inserted a large number of indigenous settlements. The printed version by Ortelius and Wytfliet greatly simplified the manuscript map, leaving out many of the settlements and rivers. It nevertheless succeeded in offering a good general impression of the area, complete with figures of latitude and longitude, the latter fairly imprecise. </p>
<p>Prominent among the rivers flowing into the Gulf is the “R. de S. Spirito,” which from its size and position must surely be an attempt to show the Mississippi River. “Florida” at the time was often shown as occupying the whole southern area of what is now the United States; the prominence of “Apalche” commemorates the ill-known Indian group known as the “Apalachee,” described by Cabeza de Vaca. The careful delineation of Cuba and the Bahama Islands reflects early Spanish knowledge of that area. </p>`;

It was the work of John Smith (1580-1631), soldier and leading figure in the English settlement of Virginia. He had spent three months in 1608 surveying the area from a small boat, and then gave the manuscript work, which must have been very detailed, to William Hole for engraving back in England. </p>
<p>The map is oriented westwards, with north at the right, and gives a remarkable impression of the rivers running into “Chesapeack” Bay. Smith ascended most of them, charting their course until the point (marked by a cross) at which the rest was “had by information of the Savages, and are set down according to their instructions.” Smith noted about 200 Indian settlements, often with such accuracy that his observations have helped recent archeological investigators; these Indian place-names find their place among some emergent English names. Smith inserted figures of both latitude (along the top) and of longitude, the latter running (contrary to later practice) from west to east (and not from Greenwich westwards). </p>
<p>Like many printed maps of the period, this one contains much imagery that is not original. Both the engraving of “Powhatan” (top left) and that of the Indian armed with a bow come originally from the drawings of John White, who had led an expedition to the area in 1587; these images were subsequently adopted by Theodor de Bry in his <em>A Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia</em> (Frankfort, 1590), from which Smith copied them.

  return `<p>Like the English, the French were long deterred by the presence of Spaniards from attempting to settle in the more welcoming parts of the New World. In the 1530s Jacques Cartier (1489-1557) did make several attempts to establish a colony on the Saint Lawrence River; he was eventually repulsed not by the Spaniards but by the severity of the climate. In the 1560s colonies were briefly established in what is now Florida by Jean Ribaut and René de Laudonnière, but these rapidly failed, in the face of intense Spanish opposition. After that, from about 1560 to 1600 the people in France were much diverted by the wars of religion. </p>
<p>Permanent French settlement of the Saint Lawrence valley would be the work of Samuel de Champlain (c. 1570-1635), whose Canadian venture began in 1603, with the powerful support of king Henri IV (1589-1610) He was an explorer of remarkable tenacity, who understood not only the limitations of his French companions, but also the need to adapt to the peculiarly difficult circumstances of the Saint Lawrence valley. He also had to contend against the arguments of men like Sully, Henry IV’s all-powerful minister, who contended that “great riches are never found in places above forty degrees of latitude.” </p>
<p>Champlain was a remarkable cartographer, who compiled many detailed maps, some of which were printed in his book, <em>Les voyages du sieur de Champlain</em> (Paris, 1613). He used these small-area manuscript maps to compile maps of much larger areas, like this <em>Carte de la nouvelle France</em>. It is extraordinary that a cartographer of the period could in ten years have compiled so extensive and precise a map, largely relying on his own travels and observations by land and sea, supplemented by what he could learn from Indian informants. The map begins to show weakness only in the far west, where Champlain still hoped that the rumored great body of water (“grand lac”) might lead directly to China. </p>
<p>This map also testifies to Champlain’s intense interest in the people and products of the country. He inserted four Indian figures, two of whom the engraver has made distinctly European in appearance; the right-hand couple’s facial features unmistakably resemble those of king Henri IV and his wife, Marie de Medici. He also drew and named a remarkable variety of indigenous fruits and vegetables. Champlain had learned his cartographic skills in the service of Henri IV (1589-1610) as lodgings-master, responsible for sketching out the towns and villages in which a French army on the march might be quartered. In this kind of mapping, essentially carried out out using pacing and map-bearings, Champlain would not have used references to latitude and longitude, which indeed are lacking from this great map. </p>`;

<p>Whereas Samuel de Champlain had learned his cartographic skill in the service of the king, the Jesuits learned to draw maps in the course of their standard education, which was heavy in the natural sciences, including astronomy and cosmography. Many of their maps—and they were numerous throughout the Americas—were therefore composed with a theoretical background involving, for instance, the use of celestial observations. Their observations of latitude were quite precise, though they could not as yet accurately calculate longitude, even though they were well aware in of how this could be done.</p>
<p>The map shows how the Jesuits were penetrating the Great Lakes by establishing missions at the nodal points. Thus on Lake Superior there were missions at the western end (“Mission du Saint Esprit,” near Duluth) and at the eastern end (“Sainte-Marie du Sault,” near Sault-Sainte-Marie). At the north end of Lake Michigan (the “Lac des Illinois’) was the “Mission de Saint-Ignace” (near the present town of Saint-Ignace), and at the southern end of Green Bay the “Mission Saint François Xavier.” Some of these missions were destroyed, and others changed location, but they were in general the centers from which the Jesuits came to understand their new mission territory. It was, for instance, from the “Mission Saint-Ignace” that Louis Joliet and Father Jacques Marquette set out in 1673 to trace the course of the Mississippi River. The prominent royal arms reminds us of the close relationship between church and state in French Canada.</p>`;

  return `<p>This map, with its Italian nomenclature, was the work of Vincenzo Coronelli (1650-1718), a Franciscan friar from Venice who first became famous for constructing two huge manuscript globes—one of the earth and one of the heavens—for the French King Louis XIV in Paris. Returning to Venice, Coronelli established in his convent a huge globe-manufacturing enterprise, in which he collected information, trained engravers and instructed workmen in the art of attaching the segments, or “gores,” so skillfully to the basic globes that it was hard to detect the seams. </p>
<p>The present map is in fact a gore designed for a forty-two-inch globe, and includes the latest information about the cartography of North America. Hudson Bay and the Great Lakes are now known in general outline, and Coronelli has been able to include figures not only of latitude but also of longitude (see the figures across Hudson Bay). Colored lines mark the extent of the English settlement on the east coast, and of the Spaniards in the greatly expanded “Florida;” much of the rest of North America forms part of French “Canada.” </p>
<p>Coronelli has done his best, using small images drawn from a variety of other publications, to show the activities of some of the indigenous inhabitants. Sometimes these are rather incongruous, like the person in the hammock (upper left) somewhere in the inhospitable northern fastness, or the New England-style palisaded villages down in what is now New Mexico (lower left). He has clearly been impressed by tales of alligators by the lower Mississippi River. </p>
<p>The great weakness of this map is its westerly displacement, by about 300 miles, of the north-south course of the Mississippi River. The Jesuit map of the Great Lakes (see previous map) had given Lake Superior too long a westward extension, and the maps generated by Joliet in the later 1670s had compounded the problem by greatly exaggerating the length of the rivers, particularly the Illinois River, connecting the Mississippi River to the Great Lakes system. No wonder that working off an assumption like this, when La Salle tried to sail from the West Indies to the mouth of the Mississippi River, he ended up in an inhospitable region of Texas, where he perished in 1687. This was a good example of the way in which maps can mislead explorers. </p>`;

After ten years of obscurity, in 1703 he published the three works for which he is famous : </p>
<p>_• Nouveaux Voyages dans l’Amérique septentrionale </p>
<p>• Mémoires de l’Amérique septentrionale </p>
<p>• Supplément aux voyages._ </p>
<p>Our map appears in the first of these, translated as “New Voyages in Northern America.” Lahontan claimed to have drawn this map after a long and arduous voyage between September 1688 and May 1689, during which he covered about 1,000 miles of the “Rivière Longue,” or “Long River.” Some scholars have found it absurd to claim that so demanding a voyage could be made in the dead of winter, and have consequently denied that the voyage ever took place. Moreover, Lahontan’s illustrations of a longhouse and a canoe seem to be a combination of objects found among Eastern tribes and in the Great Lakes. However, there is no denying that the “Rivière Longue” generally follows the line of the Missouri River, or that the map shows across the western mountains (near the “Pays des Gnasitares”) another great river (presumably the Columbia) leading to the Pacific Ocean. Lahontan clearly did not personally explore all these water-courses, but he may well have learned of them from informants among the Indian peoples, with whom he was notably familiar. </p>
<p>Lahontan’s work was highly influential. His books were translated into English, Dutch, German and Italian, and elements of this map were copied by the leading cartographers of the day. In his admiration for some of the practices of the Indian peoples he was among the earliest to put forward the idea of the “noble savage.” Lahontan’s work may be criticized in detail, but there is no denying its widespread influence. </p>`;

In previous maps, we have traced the activity of the Spaniards in the south, and of the French and English on the eastern seaboard, even extending as far north as Hudson Bay. Vitus Bering’s voyage of 1728, tracked on this map, had established that Asiatic Russia ended at the strait now named after him. But there remained a great gap between Bering Strait and the Spanish settlement in California. </p>
<p>This map sets out that uncertainty. On the coast north of California, there is mention of the shadowy English claim to “New Albion,” and then, north of that, some indication of the “River of the West,” which is the Columbia River. North again, the tracks of two Russian voyages come in from the west, so as to offer some idea of parts of the coast of what is now Alaska. North again of that coast an area is inserted largely by guesswork, and the coastline is altogether lacking on the far northern edge of the continent. </p>
<p>The northwest coast of North America would not be accurately delineated until the 1778 voyage of Captain James Cook (1728-1779). For the time being, it could at least be said that informed Europeans no longer believed that the Pacific Ocean might be found just west of the Great Lakes, as had once been thought. But this image, copied by Thomas Jefferys (c. 1710-1771) from the work of Gerhard Müller, still did not succeed in offering a vision of the great east-west extent of North America. </p>`;

  return `<p>By the 1780s, Europeans had established settlements in many areas of inland north America, as well as along many coasts. Spaniards had long been established on the Rio Grande, as far north as Santa Fe, and there were French settlements along the great arc of inland waterways, from New Orleans to Québec, passing through the Great Lakes. English settlements had pushed westward to the mountain barrier of the Appalachians, though here for the time being they had been halted, both by the terrain and by the disinclination of the British government to allow further westward expansion into lands occupied by indigenous peoples. </p>
<p>With the conclusion of the Revolutionary War, the British impediment to settlement across the Appalachians was removed, and our map belongs exactly to that period. It was drawn by John Filson (c. 1747-1788), who was himself part of the expansion, having acquired lands in Kentucky about 1783, the year of the Peace of Paris, ending the war between Great Britain and the newly-United States. The very next year, Filson published <em>The Discovery, Settlement and Present State of Kentucke</em>, which was accompanied by this map. This account of frontier possibilities proved extremely popular, appearing in both French (1785) and German (1790) editions. Its tone was set by the appendix describing the adventures of Daniel Boone, the very model of the frontiersman. </p>
<p>The map also went through several editions. In the center is Lexington, where Filson first settled, and a little south of that is “Coll. Boon’s.” Louisville has emerged to the west, on the Ohio River, and the “explanation” at the top lists the objects of interest in an emergent territory; not only towns and mills, but also “salt springs,” “licks” and “wigwams.” Maps like this were a powerful incentive to draw both residents and immigrants into the process of westward expansion, for they projected the image of a settled country, in which new settlers could easily imagine themselves selecting a promising site. The very style of the map, with its cool elegance, belied the reality on the ground, which was one of wilderness and contention. </p>`;

  return `<p>Towards the end of the eighteenth century, the northwest Pacific coast was well mapped, thanks not only to James Cook (1728-1779) but also to George Vancouver (1757-1798), and in the heart of North America a variety of individuals, mostly hunting for fur-bearing animals, had reached the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains. As yet, however, no European map had succeeded in joining these two regions cartographically.</p>
<p>This would be the work of Andrew Mackenzie (1764-1820). Born in Scotland, he emigrated to North America in 1774. Beginning in New York, in 1778 he went to work for a fur-trading company in Montréal. In 1785 he was sent north to Athabasca, and four years later founded Fort Chipewyan, seen on our map where the yellow track joins the red. Mackenzie was very curious to know how the Pacific Ocean might be reached from this site, and in 1789 set out on an exploratory voyage (see the northerly red track), in which he ended up, to his dismay, on the Arctic Ocean.</p>
<p>One of his problems on his voyage had been the difficulty of accurately calculating longitude, and in 1791 he went for advice to London, where he bought a chronometer. This was of great use on his second voyage (1792-3), in which he successfully traversed the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Ocean, emerging at Bella Coola (now in British Columbia). Mackenzie thus showed the way to the Pacific Ocean ten years before the better-known travels of Lewis and Clark (1805-6), publishing his work in 1801 with the title <em>Voyages from Montreal on the River St. Lawrence</em>. Unlike many explorers, he successfully returned to his native land, Scotland, and enjoyed a long and prosperous retirement.</p>
<p>For Mackenzie, “America” was in effect constituted by what we now know as Canada, and his mapping of this vast area reflects the Europeans’ new-found skill at delineating whole continents, with quite small inlets shown with precision, and the whole structure netted in to the system of latitude and longitude. Few explorers’ travels have been shown with such elegance and precision.</p>`;

The title names John Stuart, Superintendent for Indian Affairs, who was a likelier source for the updated information. As Superintendent, Stuart had a keen interest in surveys of the southern colonies, as he was charged with negotiating and surveying the 1763 Proclamation line between the numerous Indians of the Southeast and the southern colonies.

  return `<p>One of the earliest canal maps published in the United States was a simple route map connecting two of the most important seaports of the new nation by way of inland navigation. But it was not intended to present a particular route or advance a specific proposal. Instead, it illustrated one practical application of a new, revolutionary method for developing canals in the United States. At the time, the nation was struggling to develop a transportation system in order to advance its economy with very limited sources of capital. In the midst of the Napoleonic Wars, it was also facing difficulties raising funds abroad. The Embargo Act was, in effect, forcing the US to rely on its own resources. </p>
<p>Christopher Colles, an engineer by profession, advanced a novel idea that would take advantage of the abundant forests that covered America from the Atlantic Coast to the Mississippi Valley. His plan is discussed in the next essay on canal maps but can be simply put: Use timber to build elevated canals and save the expense of digging; then sell the land along the waterway to finance the project. Thus to fully understand this map one needs to view its accompanying drawings, in this case a cross-section of the elevated canal and a plat of the lots to be sold along the right-of-way. One additional map-reading aid, placed at the end of the twenty-two-page pamphlet, charts the “Comparative Expense of Navigable Canals in England and America.” Therefore the map provides a fundamental example of the nature of canal cartography: a reader usually needs assistance provided by additional maps, drawings, charts, or tables, as well as a text, to fully understand the sheet at hand. </p>
<p>But a question remains about this pioneer American map of inland navigation: Why did Colles select a New Jersey route for his example? Why did he not propose an early version of the Erie Canal instead? The simple answer was the economy. Colles was the first person to make a formal proposal for a canal connecting the Hudson River with the Great Lakes. Twenty-four years earlier, in 1784, Colles had sent a memorial to the New York legislature urging them to improve the navigation of the Mohawk River and then connect its headwaters at Wood Creek with Lake Ontario. The legislature did not want to get involved with the project and suggested that private enterprise do the job. The state did, however, provide funds for Colles to elaborate his proposal and “exhibit a plan thereof to the legislature at their next meeting,” meanwhile securing investors for the project. The drawings, if there were any, have not come to light, but Colles did elaborate his ideas in a pamphlet with an interesting title: <em>Proposals for the Speedy Settlement of the Waste and Unappropriated Lands on the Western Frontier</em> (New York: Samuel Louden, 1785). The next year a committee of the legislature invited Colles to continue his work, but apparently investors could not be secured for this “wilderness” improvement. The idea was abandoned and passed into obscurity, not to be recalled until the “Wedding of the Waters” ceremony at the completion of the Erie Canal thirty years later. (See David Hosack, <em>Memoir of DeWitt Clinton</em>). </p>
<p>Even before this project came to naught, Colles had suggested a system for supplying good water to the city of New York, but without success. Then came the failure of his wilderness canal idea. It was followed by the nation’s first road atlas in 1789-1792, a celebrated historical document but a financial failure. As one contemporary put it, Colles “was a man of good character, an ingenious mechanician” but “considered a visionary projector, and his plans were sometimes treated with ridicule, and frequently viewed with distrust” (Hosack, 281). </p>
<p>To limit any negative impressions in his 1808 publication, Colles illustrated his idea for wooden above-ground waterways with an example connecting the nation’s two largest cities, a route that would eventually be taken by several profitable canals largely devoted to supplying New York City with anthracite coal. Note on the map how the proposed route cuts across New Jersey near the headwaters of various streams, answering possible questions about an adequate water supply. This route may also have been an appeal for support from a particular group of investors who were then interested in exploiting iron ore deposits across New Jersey, a factor that was important in the early success of the Morris Canal constructed later in the northern part of the state. The route on the Colles map was never developed, although the Delaware and Raritan Canal (proposed in 1816, completed in 1834) roughly followed the road eastward from Trenton, through Princeton, to reach the Raritan River that flowed to Amboy across from the western tip of Staten Island. </p>
<p>Note several details on the map. First, how Colles’s proposal ends near Middletown on the Atlantic Ocean, suggesting the need for the transfer of cargo and passengers to oceangoing vessels to reach New York City. Also, the engineer emphasized the boundary between East and West New Jersey because of land rights and property titles. Finally, note the major road running through Spotswood that appears on the map, suggesting an alternative route to Manhattan.</p>`;

  return `<p>Zadok Cramer, a native of New Jersey, at “a very early age” crossed the Alleghany Mountains, perhaps by way of the Potomac River, and took up an apprenticeship in printing and bookbinding at Washington, Pennsylvania. Upon completion of his responsibilities, the young man moved to Pittsburgh to practice his trade. Soon after he arrived, John Gilkison, who was setting up the first bookstore in the Western parts of the country, passed away. The young Cramer became the logical person to take over this business in 1800, and he soon gathered together several publishing ideas and, apparently as soon as he was able, acquired a printing press to print schoolbooks and other useful titles for the Ohio Valley. One of the projects that he initiated, or took over from another hand, was a set of directions for merchants descending the Ohio River and selling their goods from settlement to settlement along the way. These notes also proved valuable to pioneers who used flatboats to move their families and possessions downstream to set up farms and towns in the Ohio Valley. Thus, when the “third corrected edition” of this work appeared in 1802, under Cramer’ imprint, it was entitled <em>The Ohio and Mississippi Navigator</em>, “printed by John Scull for Zadok Cramer, bookseller and stationer.” </p>
<p>The title described the contents, first as “an ample account of those beautiful rivers” from the head of the Ohio to the mouth of the Mississippi. Next, the page indicated that the work provided descriptions of the “towns, posts, caves, ports, and harbors, etc. on their banks” and also “how to navigate them” with notes on “rocks, riffles, shoals, channels and the distances from place to place.” The contents were “first taken from the Journals of Gentlemen of observation, and now minutely corrected by several persons who have navigated those rivers for fifteen and twenty years.” </p>
<p>No copies of the first and second editions of <em>The</em> Navigator are known to have survived. These most probably were not issued by Cramer and may well have carried different titles emphasizing commerce rather than navigation. There are some hints that the original version may reach back to the 1790s under the heading of “The Trader’s Useful Guide.” Moreover, Anthony Páez Mullan of the Library of Congress has located a manuscript version in French, apparently dated 1804 and probably based on the 1802 version, which could raise additional possibilities when it is thoroughly studied. </p>
<p>At any rate, Cramer’s <em>The Navigator</em> soon became the standard navigational aid for the Western waters. By 1806 Cramer was printing his own copies, constantly enlarging the publication. In 1805 he enhanced the text with fourteen maps showing Pittsburgh and the Mississippi River. The next year he expanded cartographic coverage to show both rivers, the Ohio and the Mississippi, from the source of the former to the mouth of the latter. “We flatter ourselves with the hope that they will be found as useful to the navigator as they have been troublesome to us.” (Sixth ed., 1808, 4) This edition of the book, now at 156 pages, also included a short account of the Missouri and Columbia rivers as traversed by captains Lewis and Clark. The seventh version of the book, issued in 1811, expanded to 295 pages. It used the extra space to elaborate its commentaries on the cities and towns along the rivers. Cramer’s health was failing at this point so the volume was published with a partner. </p>
<p>Times were changing on the rivers as well. In 1811, as Nicholas Roosevelt’s steamboat departed from Pittsburgh, Cramer hailed a new era on the Western waters: “Now the white sail of commerce is to give place to vessels propelled by steam.” By the time the next version of <em>The Navigator</em> appeared, Cramer had died just short of his fortieth year of life. </p>
<p>His book and his maps, however, continued to live on, with at least four more editions appearing under Cramer’s name before 1824. Then other titles with a similar format took over the market. The most successful of these, <em>The Western Pilot</em>, by Samuel Cummings, continued to be published until 1854. Steamboats actually increased the demand for river maps and charts, and in some ways they also stimulated flatboat traffic downstream by affording a convenient way of return upstream. Thus the crude map pictured here tells many stories, not the least of which is a fundamental point about the history of travel maps in general. They usually started as written itineraries to which maps were later added. Then the text often departed to appear in separate book form and more elaborate maps stood on their own. </p>
<p>Separate maps of American rivers were beginning to appear in 1821 when the firm of Cramer &amp; Spear published the eleventh edition of <em>The Navigator</em>, largely a reprint in smaller type of the 1814 version. For example, the steamboat firm of Goodrich &amp; Company produced a strip map of the Hudson River 102 inches long in 1820. But the crude woodcut of the Ohio River at the rapids near Louisville, shown here, had a life that reached back to 1808 and extended, in a similar format, up to 1854. In a simple way, it showed a navigator where he was on the river, but he needed the text, and perhaps the services of a pilot, for a successful passage. The Louisville and Portland Canal around the “Falls of the Ohio” was not completed until 1831 and was often more serviceable to steamboats than to the smaller and cruder boats used by the common folk. Note also how this 1821 map was outdated at the time of its printing: Indiana had already been a state for five years. </p>
<p>Readers may wish to compare Cramer’s crude map of the Ohio rapids with those drawn by Thomas Hutchins in his <em>A Topographical Description of Virginia, Pennsylvania, Maryland and North Carolina</em> (London, 1778) and the one by Jared Brooks, drawn in 1807 and reprinted in 1834.</p>`;

  return `<p>This magnificent wall map, nearly four feet high and over five feet wide, is probably the most important canal map ever published in the United States. It appeared four years after the completion of the Erie Canal and just before the first railroads in the nation, short lines in the three separate locations, started operations. Railroads are, of course, included in the title of this map as proposed internal improvements, but they were considered at the time to be handmaidens to waterborne traffic, feeders and connectors used to unite canals and waterways into “one great system.” The proposed Great Western Railway, under horsepower, would connect the canals [existing and proposed] of five states between a point on the Hudson River, near New York City, “accessible at all seasons to steam ferry-boats” to “the head of steam-boat navigation on the Illinois River,” a point near Chicago, a future city which a canal commission would soon call into existence. One needed, it seems, a big map for big ideas. </p>
<p>Tanner’s great work could be considered a canal map because the ten canal profiles which surround the main presentation serve as buttresses, shoring up national unity and economic prosperity, completing nature’s plan by tying the nation together with ribbons of water. Tanner’s wall map, in the nature of waterways cartography, brings together dozens of images and is set in a whole complex of publications, including his <em>New American Atlas,</em> which dated back to 1819 and was continuously published in may editions up to 1839. This atlas furnished maps and a format for at least four other atlases issued by Tanner during this period including <em>A New College Atlas</em>. Moreover, it was Tanner’s habit to preface his early atlases with “geographical memoirs,” a practice he continued by writing a 108-page <em>Memoir of the Recent Surveys, Observations, and Internal Improvements…Intended to Accompany His New Map of the United States</em> (1829). “The profiles or vertical sections constitute one of the most valuable and interesting features of the maps,” he wrote, providing elevations above sea level for “upwards of six hundred points in various parts of the United States.” Such information was “almost indispensable to a clear understanding of matters connected with the great work of internal improvement of our country, which is everywhere in active progress.” (106 and 107) </p>
<p>In other words, put the map on the wall, study it with care, note how the various parts of the map support each other, and then listen to hear the trumpets announcing the march of progress in the Canal Era. Tanner’s <em>Memoir</em> described how he sent a circular letter to knowledgeable people throughout the nation requesting information on a variety of topics to include on his map. This “fresh information,” as he called it, often included manuscript maps of localities which had previously been “imperfectly represented on the existing maps.” This data also helped Tanner fill the spaces on the sheet “which would otherwise have been left blank,” including city plans, inset maps of metropolitan regions, charts, tables, and profiles of canals and railroads. All in all, fifteen hundred new names appeared on the map along with 22,000 miles of new roads plus 4057 miles of canals and railroads, “the greater part of which has never been traced on a map of the United States.” (104) </p>
<p>The arteries of transportation were the sinews that bound the nation together, encouraging commercial exchange, the movement of people, and the exchange of ideas. But the profiles or vertical sections constituted one of the map’s most valuable features. Most used the same horizontal scale as the main map, 30 miles to the inch, and employed a common vertical scale of 1000 feet per inch. Thus the map reader could use the profiles as keys to understanding the topography of the country, a critical key to understanding a transportation system built on canals and the navigation of inland waterways. The “general diffusion” of this topographical knowledge would, Tanner believed, help citizens not only envision the great opportunities set before them, but would also “serve to check those impractical and frivolous projects which interested speculators are constantly urging on the unwary.” (107) </p>
<p>A final feature of the map, a source of great pride to the publisher, was that all of the leading roads and most of those secondary in nature were marked with the distances between towns. This was true on the insets as well as the main map. A reader needed to work at it to get a sense of the physical nature of the country, but a traveller could tell at a glance how far it was from a present location to points beyond in every direction.</p>`;

  return `<p>Joseph Louis Etienne Cordier, a young French engineer who did outstanding work on two of Napoleon’s transportation projects, one a highway and the other a canal, soon headed the northern department of the French corps of engineers. He spent his entire career pushing a variety of projects to completion, including over twenty canals, river improvements, and harbors. To stimulate public support for these projects, and to buttress a master plan for the development of canals and waterways in France, Cordier translated from English into French the 1803 edition of John Phillips’s classic <em>A</em> <em>General History of Inland Navigation</em>. The volume appeared in Paris in 1819, packed with many diversions sounding Cordier’s favorite themes. </p>
<p>At the time of its publication, Albert Gallatin, the US Minister to France, informed the French engineer about his own interest in internal improvements, including his important “Report on Roads and Canals” presented to Congress in 1808 when he was Secretary of the Treasury. When FranVois Becquey, Cordier’s superior, issued his influential Report to the King in 1820, it bore some striking resemblances to the Gallatin Report made a dozen years earlier in America. By then Cordier had compiled a second volume of his translations of important canal documents from English into French, featuring Gallatin’s 1808 report and including documents related to the Grand Canal in New York. The sheer size of the Erie Canal, 350 miles in length, plus its enormous cost, staggered the Frenchman’s imagination. His book needed a map of that magnificent undertaking to underscore his major point: France needed a system of waterways and the Americans had shown the way. </p>
<p>It was reported that Cordier completed his second volume in 1819 but a printing issue delayed its appearance until the following year. Perhaps the maps caused the delay. The earliest printed maps of the Erie Canal appeared in the Western Canal Commission Report in 1817. Copies must have soon crossed the ocean, perhaps addressed to Albert Gallatin, and arrived in Paris in time for Cordier to have them adapted for a French audience and attached to his waiting second volume. </p>
<p>The Canal Commissioners would not issue “A New Map and Profile of the Proposed Canal from Lake Erie to the Hudson River” until 1821. And, to my knowledge, a set of maps equivalent to the three published in Paris would not appear until 1825. These were featured in Cadwallader D. Colden’s memorial volume for the “Wedding of the Waters” ceremony in New York Harbor on October 26, 1825. </p>
<p>Cordier’s set of maps carries the title “Carte du Nord Des États Unis et ou Grand Canal de Communication….” It is made up of three separate parts. The major map shows the route of the canal between Lake Erie and the Hudson River, but its regional context extends from Montreal to Lake Michigan and south to Washington, DC and the mouth of the Ohio River. The second element in the set of maps is a profile or “Nivellement” of the Grand Canal. It is somewhat sketchy to be sure and does not indicate the locks that would connect one pool of water with the next. Instead the chart shows the elevation for each pool of water. This information is then repeated in outline form on the “Plan et Profil du Canal…”, printed on a separate sheet, on which the waterway route is directly related to a profile by a series of vertical lines. On this sheet the place names are not translated into French, but apparently follow information supplied by the Canal Commissioners. </p>
<p>Given the early date of the French map, much of the data is very tentative, and many aspects of the plan had to be changed, especially in the western reaches of the canal. But as it stands, Cordier’s set of maps, appearing at such an early date, in Paris no less, points to the international importance of the Erie Canal and its monumental role in the global story of public works. </p>`;

  return `<p>The Hudson River provided a long reach into North America for ocean-going ships from the dawn of European exploration until the early nineteenth century. It was no accident that the advent of steam navigation should take place on Henry Hudson’s river or that Robert Fulton, having turned his interest from canal engineering to steamboats, should be the creative genius who demonstrated how steam could power commercial vessels. It soon became possible for steamboats to follow regular schedules up and down the Hudson River. Shortly thereafter, people wanted guidebooks to help them appreciate the passing scenery, turning passengers into tourists. The completion of the Erie and Champlain canals in 1825 accelerated this trend, and the subsequent development of railroads in the 1830s and 1840s extended the new tourist industry into the America interior. <em>Pratt’s River and Railroad Guide</em> documents this situation in 1848, the very year that the opening of the Illinois and Michigan Canal completed the promise of the canal age and hinted, at the same time, that railroad tracks would soon command over the nation’s transportation system. </p>
<p><em>Pratt’s Guide</em> extended its coverage beyond the Hudson River and the Erie Canal to provide maps of the Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, and Illinois Rivers in addition to the Hudson. Railroads had by then grown in importance so that they received equal billing in the title of Pratt’s book, but they still were called “connecting lines” between waterways, which took the major responsibility for enabling a traveler to go from Boston to New Orleans, the publisher’s way of indicating on the title page that his guide was national in scope. </p>
<p>Actually, the Hudson River maps for the booklet were adapted from an 1846 broadside map and guide to the river that “may be had at the Bar of the Steam-Boat Troy.” This earlier sheet featured a map of the Hudson at the center of a three-column format, with schedules and a guide to cities and towns on the outer two columns. Pratt simply cut the strip map of the Hudson into sections, updated it, and then developed similar maps for his other key routes. </p>
<p>The map focuses our attention on the great river, marking its flow down the center of the image, with a bold stroke. The stream’s major tributary, the Mohawk River, received a bold line as well, but it remained nameless on the page because it had been supplanted as a transportation artery by the Erie Canal and two railroads. The competition between the two railroads suggests an urban rivalry indicated in their names. Both lines cut the travel time on the Erie Canal by avoiding the long delay caused by the series of locks at the eastern end of the waterway. Note that one railroad headed toward Troy and the other connected Schenectady with Albany. In the competition between the two Hudson River ports, Albany soon won the battle due to its better rail connections and navigation facilities. (See Focus Map 6) </p>
<p>Focus Map 5 is from the first edition of Pratt’s <em>Guide,</em> which was expected to be revised and enlarged each year with a new edition appearing every January 1st. The next issue, in 1849, for example, would include the 463-mile New York and Erie Railroad “with a description of every place on the entire route.” Advertising would hold down the price of the expanded <em>Guide</em>. In 1848, about sixty firms from New York and sixteen from Philadelphia ran advertisements placed throughout the booklet. </p>
<p>The first content page of this practical publication was a chart giving the most expensive fares between cities, starting with the route between New Orleans and Boston via Chicago and Detroit in sixteen days at the first-class rate of $58. But, the table notes “that those who travel in the second train, or on deck of the steamers, and second class boats, etc. could go for much less expense.” (3) The <em>Guide</em> then provided brief paragraphs on the leading towns along each route, followed by a series of maps similar to the one shown here but at a much smaller scale. The first five maps, for example, cover the Mississippi River from Lake Pepin to New Orleans. The Erie Canal takes up three maps on pages 46 to 48, while the Hudson River needed six pages. Detailed distance charts cover all the major rivers, with 34 landings given for the route by steamboat on the Missouri River between Council Bluffs and St. Louis.</p>`;

  return `<p>Maps of rivers are often similar to canal maps because it takes more than one perspective to complete a picture of the waters. In this case the increasing size and burden of the steamboats ascending the river to connect with the Erie Canal traffic at Albany made the shallow, fluctuating channel of the river alongside Papscanee and Schodac islands a threat to navigation. S. H. Sweet, on the staff of the New York State Engineer and Surveyor, prepared this plan “for permanently improving the navigation” along this stretch of the waterway. </p>
<p>Specifically, the proposal called for building dams and jetties at the water’s edge to channel the flow into the main stream in times of low water. To make his point, Sweet provided several section views of the proposed works, portraying both the high and low waterlines of the Hudson, plus the contours of the streambed into which piles would be driven to anchor the river’s improvements. Note that the jetties would not impede the current at high water but would take effect when the water level dropped to low levels. </p>
<p>As Henry S. Tanner emphasized in his _Memoir of the Recent Survey…(_1829) (See Focus Map 4), the alert map reader interested in inland navigation must always keep the elevation of the land (and the depth of the water) in mind when looking at a map. Here the profiles suggest the general idea while the pattern of soundings made four years earlier traces the mean depth of the Hudson in systemic fashion across the riverbed. Meanwhile, hachured drawings of the hills along the littoral suggest that the land rises quickly along the banks, restricting the water’s overflow. Exceptions to this pattern are the low, marshy core of Papscanee Island, the shallows along Western Creek, and the low water upstream north of Shad Island. Dams to be placed in these areas would keep the midstream waters flowing at all times. </p>
<p>Note how Sweet has also provided additional information on the map, including “McAlpines Proposed Ship Canal and Basin” to fill in the river immediately south of Albany and east of the Albany Turnpike. The original Erie Canal Basin was located to the north on the other side of the city. Meanwhile, auxiliary facilities would soon be provided in the Albany Basin, a facility similar to the one proposed here, but located upstream along the heart of the city. Additional harbor works also occupied the east bank and Van Rensselaer Island where tracks from New England railroads met canal barges and Hudson River steamboats. </p>`;

  return `<p>This map accompanied a “Memoranda on the Assistance which can be rendered to the Province of Canada by Her Majesty’s Navy in the Event of War with the United States.” Apparently compiled by Capt. Richard Collinson in September 1861, the nine-page pamphlet was printed in London in 1862. Although much of the publication was devoted to statistical information, several points are made in the text that would help readers to understand the map. </p>
<p>In the first place, in the event of a war with Union forces in the United States and Canada, vessels of the largest size could proceed from the Atlantic Ocean to Quebec at the upper right-hand corner of the map. Vessels drawing less than eighteen feet of water could then continue on to Montreal, but the lock at the LaChine Canal above that city would limit navigation beyond that point to smaller vessels. Thus the passageway between the United States and Canada along the River Richelieu, where three railroads from Portland, Boston, and New York converge, “will probably be the scene of severe struggle.” </p>
<p>The second conclusion stated that because the St. Lawrence River serves as a boundary line between the two countries, the navigable channel would be under fire from opposing shores for a hundred miles. Sackett’s Harbor at the eastern end of Lake Ontario, the former Naval Arsenal of the United States, was no longer fortified and would be of little concern in the event of war. Instead, “the main object of the enemy will no doubt be the possession of the Welland Canal” (2) which accommodated ships with a ten-foot draft. An alternative route from the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes, safe from canons based on US soil, was the Ottawa River- Riedau Canal route, but it was only six feet deep. This alternate route is better portrayed on Focus Map 8, published in the same year, but with the economy as its theme, not military affairs. Collinson thus concluded that it would be almost impossible during wartime for any British vessel to reach Lake Huron from the sea. As a result it was “of great importance that there should be a [British] squadron upon it.” (3) </p>
<p>A third point, on the deployment of this force, focused on the occupation of Michillimackinac Island which would “close communication between Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. This stroke would “in a great measure render abortive the great naval superiority on the lakes which is at present possessed by the United States.” (3) This “great naval superiority” is spelled out in a table on page 4. The US had 248 steamboats and 958 sailing vessels totaling 319,469 tons compared with 82 and 247 comparable Canadian vessels totaling 70,734 tons. </p>
<p>Beyond concerns about naval affairs on the Great Lakes, this memorandum also included statistics on the canals in Canada and in those states of the Union bordering on the Great Lakes. These facilities would be important in the movement of supplies and the passage of ships in the event of war. The chart, for example, noted that the Erie Canal could only pass boats of 80 tons burden but the Illinois and Michigan Canal could accommodate boats of almost twice that size, 150 tons. Thus some of the Union gunboats used on the Mississippi River would probably be of greater concern to the British than similar military craft using the Hudson River. </p>`;

  return `<p>The office of the State Engineer and Surveyor needed a convenient sheet to portray the entire inland navigation system of New York State. This map would be especially useful to include in reports the agency was required to make to the legislature. S.H. Sweet, the engineer responsible for the proposed navigation improvements on the Hudson River in 1856, (see Focus Map 6) had been promoted to Deputy State Engineer and Surveyor in 1862 when this map was published as part of the office’s annual report. The profile and map appeared in this format for many years, the plates being updated and the data augmented according to each year’s activities. </p>
<p>In essence, the sheet was composed of two basic elements: first, profiles of the canal system with its various branches, but these are laid out like a map to create a schematic diagram of the whole system. Because it followed consistent scales, both vertically and horizontally, the profile of the system encroached on the sheet’s second element, a traditional “Map of the State of New York Showing Canals and Railroads.” Note how its coverage extended beyond the state’s boundaries to include adjacent states and their railroads and canals. Thus, the map pointed to the centrality of the Erie Canal in powering the economy of the region. This economic message extended to Canada as well, the map extending across the international border to include the River Richelieu Corridor, north of Lake Champlain, where a great battle was expected to take place if war were to break out between the United States and Great Britain. (Focus Map 7) </p>
<p>But Sweet’s map is silent on military matters. Sackett’s Harbor, the large US Naval Base at the western end of Lake Ontario, is not mentioned because at the time, it was largely abandoned. The map, however, includes significant economic locations such as the Anthracite Coal Region in Pennsylvania that brought great profits to the Delaware and Hudson Canal. Also, note how the map underscores major transportation corridors such as the Hudson River with railroads running along each side and then continuing northward with the Champlain Canal, to the lake itself and the River Richelieu beyond, all the way to the St. Lawrence River. </p>
<p>The canal profiles, on the other hand, are engineering documents richly supplied with elevation data and complete coverage on the feeders and their sources to maintain the levels of the various pools created by the canal, as well as jurisdictional information showing the boundaries of each division and section into which the waterway was divided. Note that some feeders, like Glen Falls, also used locks and dams. </p>
<p>One of the interesting transportation features on the map is the Erie Railroad, not identified but following a northwesterly route from New York City to Binghampton and then cutting across New York State by way of its southern counties to reach Dunkirk on Lake Erie. While the Erie Canal was under construction, political forces from these southern counties pushed the state to sponsor a survey for a southern New York Canal along this route, but the report was unfavorable due to the topography, and the surveyors recommended a railroad instead. </p>`;

  return `<p>Railroads were the big winners in competition with waterways as a result of the Civil War. Their military service in moving troops, munitions, and supplies demonstrated their essential function in economic development. Roads, canals, and steamboat navigation remained important, but with the Republican Party in control, economic development, Westward expansion, and technological innovation were given high priority. The Transcontinental Railroad, approved by the wartime Congress and supported by presidential leadership, functioned as the centerpiece of the nation’s transportation boom in the post-war decade. </p>
<p>A major issue, however, pitting interior navigation interests against railroad interests, involved the bridging of rivers by railroad companies. Abraham Lincoln himself, as a railroad lawyer, had successfully argued a case for the railroad when a steamboat struck the first railroad bridge across the Mississippi River at Rock Island. To provide an engineering context for additional bridges across the Great River, Congress in 1866 appropriated funds for a survey of the Upper Mississippi River, requesting information on “plans of construction as will offer the least impediment to the navigation of the river.” Field work, directed by the celebrated General Gouverneur K. Warren, took up the first two years, but a final report was delayed until 1878 for a variety of reasons. The document, a 232-page book with sixty-one fold-out maps, graphs, and charts probably had limited utility as new bridge technologies reduced the value of the work. By the publication date, eleven bridges had already crossed the river, while others were authorized or under construction. </p>
<p>A set of interesting maps or sections in the report portrayed the bluffs on both sides of the river, showing their generalized geology and exaggerated topography. These drawings, with the left bank at the top and the right bank at the bottom, traced the course of the Mississippi from Fort Snelling near St. Paul at the top to the Jefferson Barracks just south of St. Louis. Note that this is really a strip map in two parts, with the top set of profiles documenting the northern portion of the valley and the bottom set continuing the coverage from just south of the mouth of the Rock River in Illinois to a point immediately south of the mouth of the Missouri River. </p>
<p>In places the profile of the bluffs is not given either because these hills were composed of glacial till and not solid rock or because the flood plain reached far back from the water’s edge. In general, however, the profiles show how deeply the tributary streams, even small creeks, have cut their way through the bedrock so that their mouths equal the elevation of the Great River. A reader needs a map of the river to set these profiles into their proper context. Then one could, with some effort, piece together both the overhead perspective provided by the map and the profile view from the water’s surface. It would then be apparent that Sabula, Iowa, Sheet 2, at the top left, is a town on a low-lying island with towering palisades surrounding it. </p>`;

  return `<p>This map tells one chapter in a story that reaches back to 1785 and extends at least to 1880, almost a century of internal improvements. The idea of linking the James River, a major stream on Virginia’s Atlantic Slope, with the headwaters of the Ohio River Basin on the other side of the Appalachian Mountains, reaches back to colonial days. The Erie Canal would, of course, achieve this objective in 1825, but it would reach the basin of the Great Lakes rather than the Ohio River Valley. The Potomac River, which formed part of Virginia’s northern boundary, presented a direct, central route for a canal across the mountains and the Potomac Company, organized in 1785, eventually reached inland to Cumberland, Maryland, in 1842. But, here progress halted, and the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, although meeting some degree of success, remained a regional canal, never reaching the Ohio Valley. </p>
<p>The James River project, from the very beginning paired with the Potomac effort for political reasons, also garnered success by improving navigation to Richmond where it built a splendid harbor. Efforts to push this success upstream and cross the summit to tap the resources of the Ohio Valley, however, were hampered by a lack of financial resources. Progress might have sped up in 1859 when a French Company wanted to purchase the existing facilities and extend the canal to the Ohio River, but the Civil War destroyed these prospects and the valuable assets such as the Richmond docks as well. Moreover, the company’s properties in West Virginia were confiscated when the area achieved statehood in 1862. After the war, with the company at the ebb of its fortunes, it decided to make a desperate push for new funding, hopefully from the federal government. A publicity campaign launched by the company included the publication of maps and pamphlets underscoring the advantages of the James-Kanawha-Ohio Rivers route. </p>
<p>This map appeared in one of those publications, <em>The Central Water-Line from the Ohio River to the Virginia Capes…Affording the Shortest Outlet of Navigation from the Mississippi Basin to the Atlantic</em> (Richmond, 1868). Edward Lorraine, the company’s chief engineer, proposed a canal for steamboats only 227 miles long to make the connection. The Erie Canal, by comparison, was 363 miles long. The Great Central Water Line would be cheaper than the railroads, central to the nation, and following a route that would be open all year. </p>
<p>Matthew Fontaine Maury, the celebrated scientist, added his talents to the campaign when he joined the faculty of the Virginia Military Institute in 1868. As the Superintendent of the Physical Survey of Virginia, Maury apparently utilized many of the arguments, data, and proposals generated by the canal company and enunciated by its chief engineer. The Central Water Line idea, in Maury’s hands, became a transcontinental, even global idea, finding expression in the paragon of American waterways cartography. Focus Map 10 should be placed into the context of Maury’s classic map, “Steam Line between Norfolk &amp; Flushing” which first appeared in the <em>Physical Survey of Virginia</em> (1868). The synergy which seems plainly evident between the canal company’s Great Central Water Line idea and Maury’s broad vision manifested itself in the company’s reprinting of the <em>Physical Survey</em> maps and the many parallels between passages in their respective publications. </p>
<p>The campaign for the Central Water Line attracted support in national discussion, local politics, and Congressional actions. The General Assembly of Iowa, for instance, angry with the Chicago railroads, appealed to Congress on the canal’s behalf. Similar resolutions came from Ohio and Kansas. In 1872 Congress started to move, appropriating funds for a detailed survey. A Senate Committee kept interest alive, but the long depression of the 1870s and a devastating flood on the James River in 1878 put the matter out of hand. A railroad crossed the summit and funds, from both government and private sources, concentrated on improving navigation on the Kanawha River. Using French-inspired movable dams, the hundred-mile section of the Great Kanawha below the falls became “the first controlled-waterway navigation in American,” completed in 1891. But a water connection to the James River was never built. </p>`;

  return `<p>In 1880 Leveson Francis Vernon-Harcourt, a professor at Oxford University, gave a series of lectures on “River and Canal Enginering” at the Royal School of Military Engineering at Chatham, Kent. In reflecting on the numerous large-scale projects begun or completed in the 1870s, , who was also a practicing civil engineer, decided to turn his lectures into a book describing these recent efforts “and the principles on which they are based.” In addition, he discussed “elementary topics” so that the book would be useful to beginning students as well as experienced engineers. Volume one contained eighteen chapters illustrated with some woodcuts on subjects like “Measurement of Discharge,” and the “Improvement of Tidal Rivers.” Two chapters were needed to discuss “Works for Affording a Passage from One Level to Another.” Locks took up the whole first chapter while the second one covered barges on wheels, cradles, lifts, and inclined planes. </p>
<p>The second volume of Vernon-Harcourt’s treatise presented about a hundred illustrations on twenty-one foldout plates. To illustrate the current employment of cradles on wheels and inclined planes, the author cited the twenty-three examples on the Morris Canal in New Jersey, where gradients of one in ten lifted boats of about thirty tons burden an average of fifty-eight feet. The author probably used this canal, whose design dated back a whole generation, because it stood for decades of continuing progress in the technology of inclined planes. The cables used to hoist and lower the boats, produced by John A. Roebling, were soon also put to use in building bridges. </p>
<p>The Morris Canal Company received a charter from the state of New Jersey in 1824 after a commission appointed by the legislature surveyed the route and drafted a favorable report. Local supporters hoped to revive the dormant iron industry along its route by providing economical access to the anthracite coal resources across the Delaware River in Pennsylvania. In addition, access to the rapidly developing metropolitan area around New York City would stimulate a thriving agricultural sector in the northern part of the state. Although the canal would have Lake Hopatcong at its summit, and would cross a distance of only 90 miles, it would rise 900 feet above sea level and 750 feet above its terminus on the Delaware River, taking an extra 30 miles to wind its way across the state. </p>
<p>When the engineering feat opened in 1831, the western section employed 8 locks and eleven inclined planes, while the eastern descent required sixteen locks and twelve inclined planes. To realize these extensive engineering plans with private finances, the developers convinced the legislature to grant the company unusual banking privileges. Although this arrangement proved to be a boon in securing the necessary funds, it soon took the company into banking ventures and investments in other canal companies. A pamphlet in 1835 spelled out <em>A brief View of the Important Relations of the Morris Canal</em> <em>with the Prosperity of the City of New York</em> and led to the extension of the canal from Newark to Jersey City, thus bringing the canal directly into New York’s harbor. Mismanagement, embezzlement, and wildcat banking led to the company’s collapse in 1841 at the very time the first anthracite iron furnace along its waters started production. </p>
<p>A reorganized company worked with the emerging network of railroads and secured their cooperation in enlarging the canal and improving the incline system. Reaching its peak traffic in 1866, the canal benefitted from steady revenues and continued to upgrade its facilities. Originally powered by water wheels and employing rope pulls, the inclined planes later used cables and placed cradles on railroad cars to hoist canal boats up the inclines. These improvements made the canal an engineering marvel and a focus of attention in Vernon-Harcourt’s handbook. But the inroads made by the railroads, especially in winter when the canal was closed and coal supplies were in need, as well as the shift of the iron industry to the Bessemer process and Lake Superior ores, turned earlier profits from operations into losses after 1877. </p>
<p>In the early twentieth century the state of New Jersey took over the Morris Canal. Eventually it was used almost entirely by pleasure craft, which generated enough traffic for Rand, McNally and Company to publish a map of the canal. In 1924, due to a new demand for wells by an increasing population in the canal basin, resulting in greater competition for a limited water supply, service on the Morris Canal was discontinued. Meanwhile the 1882 treatise on rivers and canals appeared in an enlarged version in 1896, along with a long series of other publications that made Vernon-Harcourt a leading authority on waterways, harbors, and water management. The New Jersey models of inclined planes continued to function on several European canals into the twenty-first century. </p>`;

  return `<p>The discovery of gold in the Yukon District of Canada in 1896 set off a major rush to diggings in a remote part of North America. A demand for maps showing how to reach Dawson, the settlement that had sprung up on the Yukon River near the mouth of its tributary, the Klondike, was met almost immediately by cartographers working for newspapers, magazines, and established map publishers. In this case, the Matthews-Northrup Company of Buffalo, New York, employed a civil engineer, W. T. Jennings, to compile a “Map of the Western Part of the Dominion of Canada Shewing Various Routes to the Yukon.” The large sheet, measuring about thirty-nine by thirty-two inches, traced a variety of overland routes, most of which started from the railroad network across southern Canada and then proceeded by a combination of land and water courses to thread their way across the provinces and territories to reach the Yukon River. The last leg of the journey was usually by water to Dawson. </p>
<p>All of the various routes laid out by Jennings are colored in dark red, but there is no key on the map itself to distinguish segments marked by dotted lines. Perhaps these routes were not surveyed before the map was published. The overall message of the cartographer seems to be that there were many possible ways to cross North American’s subarctic forest to reach the Yukon River. The practicality of many of these routes is questionable, suggesting that the map’s intended audience consisted more of armchair dreamers rather than prospective miners. Or, it may be that some young men wanted to combine a long adventure in the wilderness with a chance to strike it rich at the end. The fur trade had set up a network of contacts between Native American villages and British agents that Jennings could tap for his map. By emphasizing passage over land, after an initial journey by railroad, the map seemed reasonable to a venturesome soul. </p>
<p>By the time the Jennings map appeared, a variety of maps and books for the prospective Klondike miner were already in print. <em>The Chicago Record,</em> which claimed to have the first newspaper correspondent at the diggings, published a 555-page book “for gold seekers” in 1897, complete with minute descriptions of the various routes, tables of distances, suggestions for outfitting, maps, and discussions of a variety of topics ranging from mining laws to mail service and women in the Klondike Country. </p>
<p>Chapter 12 discussed “The Back Door Route” by way of railroad to Edmonton, then one of several portages to the Athabasca River, following a network of Hudson Bay Company posts to Great Slave Lake and the Mackenzie River to Fort Macpherson. Then, reversing direction, it advocated use of the Peace River to reach a portage to one of the westward flowing streams, like the Porcupine or Stewart Rivers, to reach the Yukon either above or below the Klondike. “One great advantage of this route is that it is an organized line of travel, and the numerous posts of the Hudson’s Bay Company can furnish prospectors with ample supplies, enabling them to travel very light.” (185) The return voyage would be more of a challenge because it would be upstream for 1882 miles. “There is but one way to get back, and that is to draw your boat by a rope and walk along the bank a la canal-boat.” (193) </p>
<p>Mr. P.J. Curran of 5818 Aberdeen Street in Chicago had another idea. Although employed at the city’s stockyards at the time, he had eight years of experience as a Canadian mounted policeman in the British Northwest Territory. Using the same back-door route, Curran planned to start from Edmonton on March 1, 1898, probably too early to have the Jennings map in hand, but “after the most vigorous part of the winter has softened under the influences of lengthening days, and before any of the waterways have broken up, so that the journey may be made all the way with dog sledges.” (195) Expecting to make fifty miles a day over the ice, Curran estimated the expense of his trip at $600. The overland, fresh-water route would, he concluded, soon “be the popular line of march” for the gold-hunters. The map publishers in Buffalo probably had probably come to the same conclusion. </p>
<p>The building of the White Pass and Yukon Railway between 1898 and 1900 changed the picture. So did the gradual decline of the gold-seeking fever. Reality dawned. One authority estimated that only 100,000 people set out for the Klondike out of the millions that dreamed about it. Only 40,000 reached Dawson City and half of these soon gave up and departed. The diggers thus numbered about 20,000, but only 4,000 found gold and of these only 300 found enough to be considered rich. The mapmakers fared better. One map published in Vancouver sold 100,000 copies in three editions (Hayes 1999, 186), all in 1897. Other firms, based in Seattle, Chicago, Buffalo, and San Francisco, were not left out of these profitable cartographic ventures. </p>`;

  return `<p>The spectacular success of the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825 opened the Age of Canals, and no state welcomed the new era with more enthusiasm than Ohio. Proposals to connect Lake Erie and the Ohio River by a waterway date back to 1817, the very time when New York decided to dig its “big ditch” with public funds. An Ohio legislative commission investigated several proposed routes and submitted a favorable report in January 1825 for two of them: the Cleveland to Portsmouth waterway and the route north from Cincinnati. In less than a month the state had a Canal Commission, a Canal Fund, land grants, special taxes, and approval to start construction on both canals. The governor of the state immediately invited Governor Clinton of New York to turn the first shovel-full of earth at the Licking Summit near Newark on July 4, 1825. The group then travelled westward to the state capitol for a civic dinner to honor Clinton, followed by a series of public events celebrating “the father of internal improvements” in Cincinnati, Hamilton, Dayton, and other towns. On July 21st Clinton took another shovel in hand near Middletown to inaugurate the digging of the Miami and Erie Canal. </p>
<p>The enabling legislation limited the construction of the Miami Canal to the waters below the Mad River, but public interest pushed for the completion of the western waterway across Ohio. Meanwhile, Indiana was developing its own plans and requesting a federal land grant to support construction of its Wabash and Erie Canal that would utilize the Maumee River to reach the Great Lakes. In the next few years the whole system of waterways west of the Miami and Erie Canal, including links in Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, as well as the canal bypassing the Falls of the Ohio in Kentucky, received federal aid. The system as a whole, its supporters claimed, was national in scope, with Governor Clinton looking to New Orleans and the immense valley of the Mississippi River, reaching all the way to the Rocky Mountains. </p>
<p>Our focus map, drawn in 1904, summarizes these early triumphs but, at the same time, it also points to canals that were proposed but not built and others that were dug but later abandoned. The map and others like it appeared amidst a public debate on what to do about Ohio’s remaining canals: Should they be modernized or abandoned? Should the state appropriate funds to make them useful once again, or protect the taxpayers’ interest by shutting them down or selling them to private parties? The map, like the article it accompanied, by George Will Dials, advocated the continued utility of the waterways. Their present condition at the turn of the century was to be regretted, but “it is to be hoped that, following the example of Russia, Prussia, France, Austria, and New York State, Ohio will improve her inland waterways and thereby save to her citizens one-third of their transportation charges.” A good portion of these savings would, no doubt, come from the completion that canal traffic offered the railroads, keeping their charges in line. </p>
<p>When our map appeared in the <em>Ohio Archaeological and Historical Quarterly</em> (October 1904), two advanced students in the “Economic Seminary” of the Ohio State University were completing a timely book-length study of Ohio canals, not to argue either way, but to “cast some light on the current situation.” (<em>History of Ohio Canals</em> by C.C. Huntington and C. P. McClelland, 1905, 3.) They included a very similar map in their account, nearly the same because both maps were based on one prepared by Capt. Hiram M. Chittenden of the US Army Corps of Engineers. The economists also included additional cross-sections and other graphic aids in their study, including a very interesting “Diagram showing net revenues 1827-1903 and the increase of railroad mileage, 1840-1900.” (160) Net revenues skyrocketed after 1830 to reach a half million dollars in the 1850s and then fell precipitously after 1852 as the railroad mileage steadily advanced. After 1882 the canals lost money every year as Ohio’s railroad mileage climbed from 6,000 to 9,000 miles. </p>
<p>In comparing the two maps published in 1904 and 1905, the only significant difference is that the latter one, used by the economists, includes the state’s counties. This additional information subdues the impact of the waterways on the map-reader and, if one studies the image, points out that the canal system even at its greatest extent never touched more than about half of Ohio’s counties. In the end, the state abandoned its canals, but the idea remained alive, and the state’s namesake river was the nation’s first major river to be canalized (at federal expense) from its mouth to its source. </p>
<p>A 1975 study by Roger L. Ransom, reviewing the issue of “Public Canal Investment and the Opening of the Old Northwest” (Ransom, 1975), concluded that most farmers, even in the heyday of the canals, led an isolated, rural existence. Not until the railroad and telegraph arrived would Ohio be transformed into the emerging “industrial society of the Civil War period.” Canals provided an “initial impetus” to settlement, but were soon ready to be “quietly retired amid the bustle of a new and very different era.” (264) </p>`;

  return `<p>Thomas J. Vivian, the official in charge of transportation statistics for the Eleventh Census of the United States, developed this map on the basis of data gathered in 1890. The map saw publication in 1894 and the cartographer updated and revised it in 1908 as Map A for the <em>Preliminary Report of the Inland Waterways Commission</em> (see Focus Map 5). As its title spelled out, the map furnished three related data sets: (1) navigable rivers, divided into four categories depending on the depth of their channels; (2) the principal navigation routes of the Great Lakes; and (3) similar tracks taken by ocean-going coastal shipping between United States ports. By highlighting all of these water routes in red, Vivian presented the waterways as one unified system, although each major division had its own boats, heritage, rules, economic factors, and types of necessary infrastructure. And, we might add, each one also followed its own maps and cartographic traditions. International trade is generally not included on the map, although Canadian ports are included on the Great Lakes, and passage is indicated through a thin slice of Mexican territory at the head of the Gulf of California. The only indication of ships proceeding to waters off the map is the passage to the Territory of Alaska. Given the date of publication, a similar line to Hawaii was not shown in the 1890 version. </p>
<p>The inland waterways featured on the map did not include canals, and this limitation severely restricts the value of the sheet as a historical source. It is true that the future of state canals was under debate at the time (See Focus Map 13 for the situation in Ohio). Indeed, in 1898 a movement in New York state to transfer ownership of its out-of-date canal system to the federal government was narrowly defeated, and work did not begin on the modern New York State Barge Canal, the Erie Canal’s replacement, until the year Vivian’s map was published. But the Sanitary and Ship Canal from Lake Michigan to the Illinois River, which opened in 1900, was one of the engineering wonders of the world, and the harbinger of a new generation of canals. This effort demonstrated how effectively modern materials and equipment could be applied to inland waterways. It not only inspired new visions for a national waterways system but also provided new techniques that were soon to be successfully applied to the digging of the Panama Canal. </p>
<p>Thus to make this map serviceable, one needs to fill in the linkages between Albany and Buffalo and from Chicago to the Illinois River, among other additions. Also, one might mentally fill in a grand triangular canal connecting Toledo, Cincinnati, and Chicago that would soon find advocates in the Midwest. Nor had the South entirely given up on the proposals recommended by the Senate Committee on Transportation in 1872 for waterways connecting the Kanawha and James Rivers in the Virginias or the idea of an Atlantic and Great Western Canal reaching from the Georgia coast to the Tennessee River at Guntersville, Alabama. </p>
<p>As it stands, the map suggests that a dense system for inland navigation was in place in the lower Mississippi Valley with extensions to the far reaches of its major tributaries. A whole series of navigable streams crossed the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plain, but these do not show the coastal links then in existence that prefigured the Intracoastal Waterway of the Twentieth Century. </p>
<p>The portrayal of the Great Lakes navigation on the map suggests a dynamic structure but one standing in isolation without connections to the Mississippi or Hudson Valleys. The Welland Canal does provide a link across the Niagara Peninsula, but the whole thrust up the St. Lawrence seems to end at Montreal. </p>
<p>The lines of coastal shipping shown on the map are more useful in giving the distance in miles between ports than they are in outlining the pattern of the coastal trade. The relative volume or value of this commerce, like that inland or on the Great Lakes, is not shown. The map only suggests the existence or the possibility of these movements. A similar map, made after 1914, would connect the Atlantic and Pacific segments of the nation’s coastal trade by highlighting the Panama Canal. As it stood in 1890, such connections would require a long voyage around Cape Horn. </p>
<p>The limitations of Vivian’s map were the product, no doubt, of how the data was collected by the Census Bureau. As any mapmaker translates statistical information into cartographic form, there are limitations embedded in the format in which the data is provided. The lack of canals on this map provides a classic case of this point. But there are also choices to be made in how the information is presented. The use of red lines provides another striking example, suggesting a unified system that did not really exist. These issues then lead back to the purpose of the map. A reader of a map provided by the Census Bureau would expect an impartial, unbiased presentation of the facts. By including all rivers of less than a five-foot draft in their channels, Vivian was able to outline the extensive reach of the nation’s waterways, extending it to all of the states and territories except for Utah, Wyoming, Colorado, and New Mexico. Thus, the great majority of Americans reading the map would feel they were included in the dynamics of the map, a nationalizing thrust being an unstated purpose of both the map and the census. </p>`;

  return `<p>The voice of President Theodore Roosevelt, the “Trust Buster,” stands behind these two maps. On March 14, 1907, when he appointed the Inland Waterways Commission, he noted that control of the nation’s waterways rested with the Federal Government and that the power carried with it corresponding responsibilities and obligations. Up to this time the improvement of these “great natural resources” were motivated by a single purpose, such as navigation, the generation of electric power, flood control, or the irrigation of arid land. But, he concluded, “the time has come for merging local projects and uses of the inland waters in a comprehensive plan designed for the benefit of the entire country.” Conservation issues occupied a place at the center of national policy because natural resources should be valued as a legacy to be passed on, undiminished, to future generations. They were not gifts to the present powers to be consumed for current benefit. The goal for all Americans was not only the making, but also the maintenance, of prosperous homes for all the people and for coming generations. </p>
<p>The letter creating the commission is conveniently reprinted at the beginning of its <em>Preliminary Report</em> that President Roosevelt submitted to Congress on February 26, 1908. As he requested, this document summarized its work in twenty-four findings, nine recommendations, and a conclusion that the historic American policy of “almost unrestricted disposal of natural resources” had led to “unprecedented consumption…and exhaustion” of this wealth. Then, what remained, was controlled by private monopolies “to the extent that both the Federal and State sovereignties have been compelled to enact laws for the protection of the people.” The letter concluded that a policy of conservation applied to inland waterways would be so far-reaching that a grand national conference should be convened by the President. Indeed, Roosevelt had already issued such a call to the governors of every state and territory, members of Congress, the members of the Inland Waterways Commission, and other interested parties. The White House Conference on Conservation was to be held May 13-15, 1908. Thus the Commission issued this preliminary report in February 1908 to inform the attendees of the current state of their work. </p>
<p>Although this report itself took less than fifteen pages, the entire document was over 700 pages due to appendixes. The thick publication featured a dozen maps, most of them focusing on comparing freight rates charged by rail and river transport. Our focus maps present two of these rate maps centering on St. Louis, Missouri, and Portland, Oregon. President Roosevelt provided a background for these rate maps when he submitted the <em>Preliminary Report</em> to Congress. He started his letter to Congress by telling its members that the people demanded that the nation’s leaders deal with the “admitted inability of the railroads to handle promptly the traffic of the country, and especially the crops of the previous fall.” </p>
<p>The Inland Waterways Commission found that the reason for this recent breakdown of the nation’s transportation system was the “unregulated rail road competition that prevented or destroyed the development of our inland waterways.” (“Message of the President” in the <em>Preliminary Report</em>, iii) </p>
<p>The focus maps are part of the Committee’s documentation of that finding. The map and the accompanying tables demonstrate that “on the Upper Mississippi river rates are in many cases only two-thirds of the rail rate.” (325) Note that the rate between St. Paul and St. Louis was sixty-three cents per 100 pounds of first-class freight by rail, but only forty cents by water. Varying insurance charges and handling fees made up some of the difference. Nevertheless the potential savings were not available to shippers because the “railway interests have been successfully directed against the normal maintenance and development of water traffic by control of water-fronts and terminals…by discriminating tariffs, by rebates, by adverse placement of tracks and structures, and by other means.” (<em>Finding 4</em>, 19) </p>
<p>Testimony provided by a variety of experts in the case of all nine rate maps explained why the advantages to shippers by water-borne commerce were not being realized. In the case of map 9, shipments to Portland, Oregon, via the Columbia and Willamette Rivers were consistently favorable to river traffic, but a close study of them and the accompanying tables led to provocative questions on why the rates per mile varied to such an extent. The text noted that the advantages of water shipments would soon extend to Snake River ports when the work then in progress would open up a continuous uninterrupted navigation from Lewiston, Idaho, to the sea. In that sense the map is incomplete, awaiting the establishment of river freight rates on the lower Snake River. </p>
<p>Map 9 was, like the report itself, a work in progress, conceived as a foundation upon which a future, comprehensive policy for inland waterways would be based and one that would take conservation principles and the preservation of natural resources into account. Although these hopes were not to be realized in both the short term, cut off by the exigencies of the First World War, and in the long term by the appeal of local projects on their own terms to members of Congress, the <em>Preliminary Report</em> proved to be a milestone in documenting the “The Use and Abuse of America’s Natural Resources” and was reprinted by Arno Press in 1972 in a series of books under that general heading. </p>`;

  return `<p>The American experience in the First World War indicated that modern port facilities were essential to sending an American Expeditionary Force overseas and keeping it and its allies well supplied. The bottlenecks that hampered logistics during the Great War led Congress to include in the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 a provision for a series of studies reporting on the current situation of US ports and advising on ways to improve their operations. Two agencies, the Board of Engineers for Rivers and Harbors in the War Department and the United States Shipping Board, cooperated in producing, by 1930, a series of twenty-two volumes covering seventy ocean ports. The work soon extended to inland transportation on the Great Lakes (1926) and in the Mississippi Valley (1929). </p>
<p>The first volume of the Lake Series, <em>The Port of Buffalo, New York,</em> published in 1931, put the issue at hand into perspective: “The Great Lakes and their connecting channels form a natural transportation highway, which in point of volume and importance of traffic has no equal as an inland route for waterborne commerce.” Moreover, as the western terminus of the New York State Barge Canal, the city of Buffalo was “the principal transshipment port in connection with rail and lake traffic to and from the West.” (151) Most of this traffic was in bulk commodities, the port receiving grain, iron ore, and limestone and sending out coal in return. In 1930 Buffalo reigned as “the greatest grain distributing port as well as the largest milling city of the Western Hemisphere.” (152) </p>
<p>Our focus map illuminates the reach and extent of Buffalo’s role in shipping on the Great Lakes in 1929. The map is also a cartogram because the width of the lines indicated the relative volume, in short tons, of the freight received at the port. Each harbor sending freight to Buffalo sent out a line to join the aggregated total which was drawn proportional to the tonnage involved. The actual tonnage for each port is also given by a number next to its name. Note that small quantities of goods also arrived from Montreal on the St. Lawrence River and the New York State Barge Canal. </p>
<p>The general impression created by the map is that shipments of iron ore from Duluth-Superior at the western tip of Lake Superior, joined by 2.7 million tons of wheat from Port Arthur and Fort William in Canada, formed the major spine of this lake traffic. About two dozen other ports added lesser volumes to the flowage, but these shipments often carried much higher values because they included manufactured goods as well as bulk shipments of commodities. </p>
<p>The striking flow chart, folded out opposite page 150 of the report of the United States Shipping Board on <em>The Port of Buffalo</em>, should be read with its twin, which immediately follows, showing the “Destination of Lake Shipments from Buffalo” during the same year. (Focus Map 6-2) In this case the traffic sent on the New York State Barge Canal and the Hudson River, as well as that to Canadian ports, was much more significant. The bulk of this outbound tonnage was probably coal from the Pennsylvania Coal Fields, especially the broad line returning shipments to Duluth-Superior. Because this pair of maps used the same base map, the inflow and outflow of freight to Buffalo is easily compared. Note the contrast in traffic volumes on the two maps utilizing the Welland Canal between Lakes Erie and Ontario and the St. Mary’s Ship Canal at Sault Ste. Marie. A large-scale map of the “Port and Facilities at Buffalo, N.Y.” follows page 155 in the report, emphasizing the railroad connections available. </p>
<p>An “Airplane view of the Port of Buffalo, N.Y.” serves as the frontispiece for the document, folding out to provide a companion piece for the harbor map. (Focus Map 6-6) The report ends on a favorable note: “Considering the large number of railroads entering the port, the numerous waterways dividing it, and the widely separated terminals, the port is well coordinated and equipped to handle…a much greater tonnage without congestion or delay.” (153) However, it would be advisable, even necessary, to institute a port commission with the authority to oversee these further developments. </p>`;

  return `<p>In 1841 the US Lake Survey started in Buffalo, first using triangulation to map the shoreline and then moving on the waters to chart the depths of the lake. The survey did not have its own boat until 1844, at which time the pace of work accelerated. The next year the engineers moved to Detroit, completing their work on Lake Huron just before the Civil War. The survey intensified its efforts during that momentous conflict, even pressing into service a vessel captured when it tried to run a Union blockade. By 1882 the initial Lake Survey completed its work. </p>
<p>With the publication of its seventy-sixth nautical chart, the group disbanded but came to life again in 1897 with a water-levels study that utilized six vessels. The diversion of lake water into the Mississippi River by the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal (see Focus Map 9) led to a reconstitution of the Lake Survey, now given responsibility to continuously monitor the Great Lakes and its connecting waters, especially the Illinois canal. </p>
<p>Congress established funding for this activity with an Act for the “Preservation of Niagara Falls.” Then a new survey of the lakes started in 1907 and updated navigation charts were to be regularly published. The agency reached its peak during the Second World War when over a thousand employees helped to ensure the success of shipbuilding on the inland waters. After the War it added a Research Division to conduct “fresh-water oceanography” but the Lake Survey as an independent agency closed in 1976 when its functions were taken over by the National Oceanic and Aeronautics Administration (NOAA). </p>
<p>Our focus map, published in 1936, serves both as a navigation chart and a guide to Cleveland Harbor. It is also a rich historical document. When the first settlers sent by the Connecticut Land Company arrived to establish a town at the mouth of the Cuyahoga River in 1796, they soon revised their plans, relocating from the lake plain to the higher ground above the steep cliffs marked here by the contour lines bunched together following the lake shore and defining the river valley. The opening of the Erie Canal in 1825 and the completion of the Ohio and Erie Canal as far as Akron two years later, turned the mouth of Cuyahoga River into a lake port and in 1836 Cleveland became a city. In the 1850s copper ores started to arrive from Lake Superior, and iron ores soon followed. </p>
<p>The river port with its twists and turns proved inadequate by the 1870s, so planning started for an outer harbor along the lakefront protected by breakwaters. The West Basin saw completion in 1883 and the East Basin followed thirteen years later. By 1902 the seawall extended eastward, and in 1908 the entrance was enlarged. </p>
<p>The congregation of railroad facilities around the river harbor encouraged its straightening and dredging in the 1930s, work largely completed by the time of this map, which shows a twenty-foot deep channel all the way to the head of navigation. The old Central Viaduct still hindered river traffic, but the structure was dismantled in 1939, and shortly thereafter its iron scrap was turned into munitions of war. Few maps capture the dynamic qualities of the Cleveland Harbor in its peak years as vividly as this one. It is worth a close look. </p>
<p>Note that the sheet may be divided into seven sections, each with its own character. The first one, taking up the lion’s share of the sheet, is the navigation chart for the approaches to Cleveland Harbor. Two compasses, one on each side of the map, note the five degree difference between true north and the magnetic declination. The distance scale uses statute rather than nautical miles, and the depth markings read in feet not fathoms. Shallow waters appear in shades of blue, distinguishing between depths less than five, ten, twenty, and twenty-five feet. Of particular interest are the bearing lines to guide ships into the harbor, using the signal at the Waterworks Intake Crib as a point of reference. Note that this copy of the map has an additional navigation line drawn in pencil. </p>
<p>The second section on the map is the Edgewater Park area at the western part of the lakefront. Note that the Bathing Pavilion joins the Yacht Club on the lake plain at the water’s edge, while the main pavilion occupies the high ground above a steep cliff. The land-use pattern changes quickly as we proceed eastward where the West Basin and the associated peninsula formed by a branch of the river focuses attention on an industrial complex of harbor facilities, railroad yards, shipbuilding and repair structures, public utilities, warehouses, factories, and coal docks. </p>
<p>Immediately to the east, past the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern lakefront terminal, the industrial zone takes a break to accommodate passenger piers for steamers heading to Buffalo, Detroit, and other lake ports. Behind them the Municipal Stadium and airport occupy the lower land while the Central Business District takes the high ground. This downtown area is only sketched in, with the Public Square indicated and several governmental buildings labeled. The Pennsylvania Railroad Depot and Union Station are also identified, but the focal point and pride of the city, Terminal Tower, part of the Union Station complex, for some reason is not featured. The new skyscraper completed in 1930, then the tallest building in the country outside of New York City, indeed presented a striking landmark. </p>
<p>A variety of land uses characterized the East Basin, the fifth region on the map. Here the industrial city continued both at the shoreline and on the heights with the New York Central Railroad threading through industrial facilities along its tracks: gas and electric companies, in addition to iron and steel mills. On the lowlands below, a sawmill, terminal facilities, and the city water works at the end of the intake tunnel spread out among storage yards that pressed for more space. Hence a “dumping grounds” in shallow waters was filling up to supply additional acreage. Continuing eastward, beyond the basin, where Doan Creek cut through the cliff separating the high- and lowlands, recreational facilities took over in Gordon Park, our sixth area, a residential neighborhood with a bathing beach. </p>
<p>The final region shown in detail on the map is the industrial valley of the twisting Cuyahoga River. Note that the Valley Race Track brought a recreational land use onto the valley floor near the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad yards with its large roundhouse. Down river from these facilities several steel companies cluster together near the end of the navigation channel. Upstream fuel and chemical plants carry familiar names: Standard Oil, Gulf Refining, and the Shell Petroleum Company. </p>`;

  return `<p>The US Army Corps of Engineers, Chicago District, of the US Lake Survey, (see Focus Map 17) issued these maps as part of its navigation atlas of the Illinois Waterway in 1970. The seventy-seven-plate compilation, which sometimes pictured two charts on one sheet, included an index map at the front as well as a profile of the waterway. This sheet charted the seven locks and dams that created eight pools for reaching Lake Michigan from the Mississippi River by way of the Illinois stream. It also included a map of the United States showing its principal waterways to provide a national context for the Illinois Waterway, emphasizing how it connected the Mississippi River System with the Great Lakes and the Atlantic Ocean. A page of “Rules of the Road” faced the US map and ten points of general information for navigators on the waterway followed. The atlas addressed recreational boaters in addition to the shipping industry, marking the channel nine feet deep, as well as providing a sailing line and indicating all navigational aids. Mileage to the mouth of the Mississippi appears on both sides of every plate. </p>
<p>Every bridge was named and located both on the index map and the individual sheets. Some of them are fixed in height, and others are moveable to provide clearance for the passage of ships. Note the various railroad and highway bridges shown on these maps. By consulting the index map, the reader could learn that the first bridge on Plate 33, proceeding downstream, named Murray Baker, is a fixed high bridge to carry Interstate 74 across the Illinois River. The next one, the Franklin Street Bridge, was also fixed, but the adjacent lower railroad structure is a swing bridge. The next one, serving a highway, is fixed, but the Peoria &amp; Pekin Union Railway Bridge is a bascule lift bridge. By consulting item 6A on the “general information” page at the beginning of the atlas, a novice navigator would learn that the vertical clearance for the fixed bridges would be 58.8 feet above the normal pool stage but only 41.7 feet above extremely high water. </p>
<p>Before proceeding through the Peoria lock featured on Plate 33, a navigator would find detailed instructions on the map itself as well as directions for obtaining the pamphlet giving the regulations governing the use of these locks. In addition, the “general information” page provided a reminder that “small boats may be required to wait a short time in order to lock through with a large boat.” A cross- section of the Peoria Lock and the wicket for discharging the lock water also appear on the map, items of interest for large tows bringing a tie of barges through the lock. </p>
<p>When a boat approached the Chicago Harbor (on Chart 70), or the alternative Calumet Harbor (on Chart 77), the sheet advised its navigator to consult US Lake Survey Charts 752 and 775 respectively, each one providing much more detail, especially in water depths, than provided on the waterway sheets (Focus Map 17). The cityscape along the waterfront is also described in greater detail on the harbor charts. </p>
<p>These waterway charts often provide an abundance of historical data along the littoral. Note, for example, how Plate 34 illustrates the mixed land use along the shores of Lake Peoria. On the right bank, the Peoria Boat Club, with a gasoline service facility, occupies the land at Mile 164. As one proceeds downstream, industrial and transportation facilities take over before the Peoria Landing, the historic river port where the Rock Island Railroad depot stands next to the municipal dock and terminal. On the opposite shore of the lake, Pendola’s Boating and Fishing Harbor comes first, followed by a grain loading dock with its own navigation channel, a diversion channel for Farm Creek, and a US Coast Guard Base centered between an electrical generating plant and an oil refinery. Up Farm Creek, the large manufacturing facility of the Caterpillar Tractor Company received service mainly from railroads. Note how the huge plant was protected by two levees on either side of Caterpillar Bay. </p>
<p>The next plate, number 33, preceding downstream from Mile 161.9, reveals the impact of the physical landscape on human development. Note how the former Caterpillar Bay has been turned into a backwater lake by the construction of a levee indicated by the thin line with triangles behind the thick solid black line that marks the shoreline. A pump house in the southwest corner of the protected land sends excess water over the levee and into the river. The East Peoria Drainage and Levee District seems to be planning roads inside the protected area for industrial use. The Peoria and Pekin Union Railway already services the area, but no buildings are indicated on the map at this time. </p>
<p>Across the Illinois River, on high ground along the right bank, a series of industrial facilities extends below Mile 161.9: a gas works, the huge Hiram Walker Distillery, various meat-packing plants, a railroad roundhouse, and the Peoria Sewage Treatment Plant. </p>
<p>The top panel on Sheet 33 shows how the pattern of land use seems to reverse itself after Mile 158.9, as various dockage facilities and the control station for the Peoria Lock occupy the left bank, leaving the right bank in a more natural state with its backwater lake and wooded island suggesting a low wetland environment. This entire littoral area would seem to be easily adapted to a variety of human uses if economic factors shift in favor of riverfront development. Comparing past and future editions of these navigation charts will help document these changes over time, as well as variations on the river itself. </p>`;

  return `<p>The United States Coast and Geodetic Survey has a long history extending back to the nation’s founding. Its original function, to chart the nation’s Atlantic coast, addressed the needs of ocean-going ships, but the submerged coastal plain offered many opportunities for these ships to sail far inland, utilizing the bays, rivers, and sounds, all protected by barrier islands and peninsulas extending from the mainland. The original mapping of this broken coastline, going back to the efforts of John Smith and other early explorers, encouraged navigators to think about connecting these inland venues to create a protected waterway paralleling the coastline.</p>
<p>Some of the earliest proposals for canals in North America focused on these links. William Byrd II of Westover made one such recommendation in 1728. Thus, we find that American canal history, in its origins, may be divided into canals that reached into the interior of the continent and those that linked sheltered waters along the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal Plains. Another early focus for the improvement of interior coastal waters envisioned connecting Albemarle Sound with Chesapeake Bay. Later the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal linked these two bays along the Mid-Atlantic Coast, and the Delaware and Hudson Canal provided a final link that could be extended into the Midcontinent by way of the Erie Canal.</p>
<p>These coastal linkages found cartographic expression in a series of documents focusing on individual links in what eventually became a system called the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway in the early twentieth century. The US Coastal and Geodetic Survey regularly published navigation charts and maps of these inland passages, and its book-length <em>Inside Route Pilot: Intracoastal Waterway, New York to Key West,</em> provided commentary and directions for navigators, both professional and recreational. It appeared in many editions starting in 1912.</p>
<p>The three charts provided here represented both the second and fourth edition of the series covering New Jersey waters, first issued in 1940. A navigator in the summer of 1949 would use these connected sheets to ply the protected waters, starting from the Manasquan Inlet, the northern entrance to the waterway from the Atlantic Ocean. Sheet 825 (the fourth edition of the 1940 base map, corrected to July, 1946) uses two panels to show the route to Little Egg Harbor. The line of navigation, printed in red, utilizes navigational bearings, and a compass showing the magnetic variation in 1950 is printed on every sheet.</p>
<p>Chart 826 continues the navigation line to Longport, just south of Atlantic City. In this case the one map takes up the whole sheet. Again, it is the fourth edition of this sheet, but it carries a date of June 1949. Sheet 827, which completes the route to Cape May, was only in its second edition, updated to October 1943. A blue stamped date of June 12, 1950 at the bottom of the sheet assured navigators that the “lights, beacons, buoys, and dangers [noted on the map were] corrected for information received to the following date.” This sheet used three maps, two to bring the series to Cape Map and a third tracing an extension of the Great Egg River westward to May’s Landing.</p>
<p>The information provided on these navigation charts directly addressed the needs of navigators: water depths, in feet at mean low water, locations of navigation aids; heights in feet of bridge clearances; distances in nautical miles; dangers such as rocks, wrecks, shifting sand bars; and a grid of latitude and longitude at five-minute intervals. On land, the road pattern is clearly indicated with every street shown for urban areas and villages. Place names abound, and navigation landmarks like water tanks, towers, large buildings, docks, and harbors are always identified.</p>
<p>These coastal charts are of great interest to historians because they present a detailed portrayal of both the waters themselves and the development of the littoral. They were also revised, periodically updated, and appeared in many editions, thus documenting coastal changes for almost a century. Various issues of the <em>Inside Route Pilot</em> also contain a valuable text with information on the use of the waterway, current problems in navigating the route, improvements in process, advice on finding supplies and provisions, and historical details with notes on ruins or relic features both in the water and along the shore.</p>
<p>For example, the 1920 (second) edition of the <em>Inside Route Pilot: Coast of New Jersey</em> suggests that a “stranger” entering the Barnegat Inlet use a pilot, “either picking up a fisherman outside or setting signal and waiting for one from Barnegat City.” (12) Once inside the waterway, a boat seeking a place for a stop should know that the summer resort at the end of the railway at Barnegat City includes “a permanent settlement of oystermen and fishermen.” To reach this complex, however, a boater needed to use “a privately dredged channel [which] leads from the main channel southward to the landings on the inner branch just inside the point.” These directions were of obvious value to someone in need in 1920 but also open windows for the historian or story writer of a later date.</p>
<p>The information given in the larger book for the entire route from New York to Key West does not usually carry the same amount of detail but nevertheless can be used to put the information from other editions into various contexts. For example, if we check the comments on the Barnegat Inlet in the eighth edition (1936), the major issue was prevailing northeast winds when “the channel changes so rapidly that directions are impossible,” and the inlet, “unless unusually smooth, …is then impossible for any type of boat to enter” (15).</p>`;

  return `<p>In 1964 the Tennessee Valley Authority published its <em>Technical Report No. 25:</em> <em>The Tennessee River Navigation System: History, Development, and Operation</em>. To illustrate the extent of its geographical reach, the agency prepared this cartogram (Figure 191 on page 211) based on data from the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC). The ICC had granted licenses to twenty-seven commercial barge lines to operate as common carriers between the various ports, designated by circles on the map. Each company so licensed received a line between its authorized ports and a letter of the alphabet that identified its name and address listed on the following page. Thus line “G” on the diagram represents the Federal Barge Lines, Inc. of St. Louis, which held rights to carry general commodities between Sioux City, Port Argill, Stillwater, Waukegan, and New Orleans, plus all intervening ports, as well as the Warrior River ports serving Mobile. In addition, this company could shuttle its barges between New Orleans and Mobile as a common carrier on the Intracoastal Waterway. </p>
<p>The cartogram thus provides a general picture of the extent of commercial barge operations in the Mississippi River system and its interconnecting inland waterways in 1964. The Intracoastal Waterway on the Gulf of Mexico as well as Lake Michigan ports reached by way of the Illinois Waterway were considered extensions of the Great River for the purpose of this chart. Note that the volume of the traffic in terms of weight or value is not given and can only be inferred in a general way. Nevertheless, the graphic presents a striking image of the overall pattern of traffic in 1965. </p>
<p>Appendix D of the publication elaborated on various aspects of the waterway, providing similar maps showing the depth of the commercial channels (284), the distance between selected ports (285), and the railroads (285-289), major highways (290-291), and common carrier truck lines (294-295) serving many of the featured ports. The last three maps in this appendix cover only the Tennessee Valley and its adjoining region; however, these maps were drawn before 1940, severely limiting their use in 1965. Nevertheless, as historical documents, the group as a whole underscores the interconnected nature of the transportation system serving the region. </p>
<p>The major purpose of the maps as well as the text was to place the Tennessee Valley in the broader context of the Mississippi Valley and extend its reach northward to the Great Lakes and southward into the Gulf of Mexico. The map carries additional cartographic interest because it does not show any land, only waterways channels, rivers, lakes, ports, and a gulf. The landless graphic without shorelines relies on the reader’s mental map of Mid-America to convey its message. Lake Michigan, the Appalachian Mountains, Florida, and the other states are not portrayed, but seem to automatically appear in the mind’s eye. </p>`;

  return `<p>While some migration guidebooks, such as Traugott Bromme’s <em>Rathgeber für Auswanderungslustige</em>, provided a broad geographical context for migration, others were intended to promote emigration to more focused geographic regions. One example is Francis J. Grund’s <em>Handbuch und Wegweiser für Auswanderer nach den Vereinigten Staaten von Nordamerika</em> … (2. Auf., Stuttgart and Tübingen: J.G. Cotta’scher Verlag, 1846)., which promoted German migration specifically to the Midwestern States and territories of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Iowa, with Texas addressed in a short addendum. All of these locations were primary destinations within North America for German emigrants beginning in the 1840s and 1850s. </p>
<p>The guidebook’s information is presented in ten chapters. The first four provide an overview of the United States and general information about its history and geography. For example, one chapter explains the rectangular survey system, which was the predominant means of surveying and selling land in the states carved out of the Old Northwest. This explanation even includes a diagram demonstrating how a township was divided into sections and quarter sections, the primary unit for land sales to many immigrant families. </p>
<p>The other six chapters address each of the designated states and territories in separate chapters. Each chapter follows a similar pattern, providing a discussion of the state’s settlement history, demographics, physical geography, and transportation network, accompanied by a short description of each county and tables of distances between major cities. In the Illinois chapter, we learn that Cook County contains 1,000 square miles; the ground is undulating and covered with forest and prairie; the major streams are the Calumet, Chicago, and Des Plaines; the population in 1835 was 9,826 and in 1840 was 10,201; Chicago was the county seat and the largest city in the state, with a population of 4,470 in 1840; and the Illinois and Michigan Canal provided a connection between Lake Michigan and the Mississippi River. </p>
<p>In order to illustrate and reinforce the guidebook’s primary focus, it was accompanied by one large foldout map depicting these Midwestern states and territories in much greater detail than the numerous small maps in Bromme’s guidebook. The map showed not only state boundaries and major cities, but also mapped and named individual counties and county seats, located a selection of smaller towns and villages, and displayed canals and major roads. It also outlined the extent of the rectangular townships which were surveyed under the direction of the US General Land Office. This delineation of surveyed townships indicates those lands that were potentially open for settlement, especially along the advancing frontier regions of Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Missouri, which bordered lands reserved for various Native American groups. </p>
<p>The German bias of this map can be seen with the selection of some of the smaller towns that were included. For example, in southeastern Ohio, Gnadenhutten in Tuscarawas County and Dresden in Muskingum County were depicted, while other towns of similar size were not. The former village is well known as Ohio’s oldest existing settlement, founded by Moravian missionaries and populated by Lenni Lenape Native Americans, and the site of a massacre in 1782 during the Revolutionary War. The latter village, founded in 1817 on the site of Wakatomika, a Native American village, developed into a small industrial center on an extension of the Ohio and Erie Canal. By the mid-nineteenth century, it attracted a significant German population, evidenced by the presence of both a German Methodist and a German Lutheran church. </p>
<p>Francis Grund, the author of this book, was born in Reichenberg, Bohemia, in 1804. By 1827, he was working in Boston as a mathematics teacher. Although he is best remembered as a journalist, editor, and political commentator, he also prepared a number of mathematical text books in addition to this travel guide. </p>`;

  return `<p>As immigrants and travelers planned their journeys to the United States and from the port cities to interior destinations, they referenced a variety of promotional maps, such as the seventeen maps and plans included in Traugott Bromme’s <em>Rathgeber für Auswanderungslustige</em>, a guide for German emigrants published in Stuttgart in 1846. </p>
<p>Most of the narrative and maps in this guide pertained to the United States. The maps included a general reference map of the eastern two-thirds of the United States locating the major cities and towns throughout the country. For more detailed reference, there were maps of individual states or pairs of neighboring states (New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey, Ohio and Indiana, Illinois and Missouri, Michigan and Wisconsin, Virginia and Maryland, Kentucky and Tennessee, Georgia and Alabama, and Louisiana and Mississippi), providing geographical coverage of most of the states east of the Mississippi River. In addition there were maps of several major cities (Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, DC), which would most likely serve as ports of entry for many of the immigrants. There were also four maps providing coverage of the areas around St. Louis; the lead mining district of southwestern Wisconsin; Lexington, Kentucky; and Nashville, Tennessee. While German immigrants would probably find the first two locations attractive, it is somewhat surprising that the latter two were selected for his type of coverage, since Germans did not settle in large numbers in the southern states before the Civil War because of their opposition to slavery and the limited economic opportunities of a plantation economy. </p>
<p>Since the guide addressed German emigration in general, there were also discussions of the geographical conditions in areas outside of the United States. In support of these discussions there were maps of Quebec, Montreal, South America, and Australia. </p>
<p>Bromme, originally from Leipzig and Dresden, Germany, travelled extensively in the United States in the 1820s and early 1830s, just prior to the beginning of massive German immigration into the United States during the nineteenth century. He recorded his observations in numerous travel accounts published in the 1830s and travel guides issued in numerous editions in the 1840s and 1850s. One such example is <em>Hand- und Reisebuch für Auswanderer nach den Vereinigten Staaten von Nord Amerika</em> (Bayreuth, 1848), which was published in several editions starting in 1848. This particular publication included a map that emphasized the post roads, canals and railroads, which would be a useful resource for immigrants planning their journeys throughout the United States (Grim 1994, 59-61). Publications such as this, were typical of a multitude of travelogues and guidebooks that were published during the nineteenth century encouraging emigration from various European countries. </p>`;

  return `<p>A third type of travel guide promoting migration provides directions for traveling along a single route. One such example is Joseph Ware’s <em>The Emigrant Guide to California</em>, published in St. Louis in 1849. In outlining the primary route from Independence, Missouri, to the California gold fields, this guide documents one aspect of the westward migration within the United States, whether the emigrants intended to stay a short time for quick personal gain or to make a western location their permanent residence. </p>
<p>In a version edited by John Caughey and reprinted by Princeton University Press in 1932, the editor recognized that this work was the first travel guide to provide a complete description of the primary route to California for the group of prospective miners known as “forty-niners,” and it continued to be the best source of travel information for several years. It appears that Ware did not travel this route himself before he composed this travel guide. Rather, he based his narrative and advice on information that he gathered from other sources, but primarily relied upon the published accounts of John C. Fremont’s first two expeditions in 1842 and 1843-44. As a synthesis of information, it provided a good description of the route, but was not without errors. </p>
<p>In the first part of Ware’s presentation, he discussed various options for travelling from the eastern United States to California, including by sea around the southern tip of South America, by sea and land across the Isthmus of Panama or Mexico, or overland, starting in Independence, Missouri. He compared modes of transportation, costs, and length of traveling time, concluding that the overland route was the best for residents of the Midwestern states. For those who chose the latter route, he suggested the best times for departure so that the trek could be concluded before winter snows. He gave other practical advice, such as the type and quantity of supplies that would be needed and how to set up a camp of wagons in order to provide protection from attack by Native Americans. </p>
<p>The remainder of the guide provided a running narrative describing the route, generally presenting information about distances, grades, water crossings, availability of potable water, and camp site locations. For example, in Kansas, he noted “Little Blue, twenty-eight miles from the Big Blue. It is fifty feet wide, timber plenty, grass and water good. You are now in Pawnee country. Watchfulness is required to prevent their stealing your stock. Your camp must be well guarded every night, and your stock caraled (sic), if necessary.” </p>
<p>This little guide book is accompanied by a large fold-out map showing the full extent of the route, as well as a profile recording elevations along the route. For anyone familiar with the mapping of western exploration, it is readily apparent that this map is an almost exact copy of the map prepared by German immigrant Charles Preuss to accompany John C. Fremont’s report, published as a Congressional Serial document in 1845 (Grim 1994, 100-102). Ware made only two substantial changes to the Fremont/Preuss map. First, he added an inset diagram of the Midwestern states outlining the primary routes across those states to Independence. Secondly, he sketched the southerly route from Fort Hall (Idaho) across Nevada’s Great Basin to San Francisco, rather than the northerly route from Fort Hall to the Oregon Territory, as was depicted on the Fremont map. For “forty-niners,” Ware’s map was more useful than Fremont’s because it traced the complete trail to California. </p>`;

  return `<p>Although there were a few attempts to prepare statistical maps based on the 1860 US Census (Caption 5), the first atlas devoted exclusively to mapping census data started with the 1870 census. Similar, but more comprehensive atlases appeared for the 1880 and 1890 censuses. The latter, noted for its use of innovative graphic presentations such as bar graphs, pie diagrams, and population pyramids, is the most interesting of the three. It was published in 1898 under the direction of Henry Gannett, geographer of both the US Census Office and Geological Survey (Dahmann). </p>
<p>Especially interesting are the thematic maps and statistical graphs presenting demographic data pertaining to the 1890 immigrant or foreign born population. These include a map showing the distribution of the total foreign born population, as well as individual maps depicting the spatial distributions of foreign born immigrants from Canada, Great Britain, Ireland, Scandinavia, and the Germanic states. </p>
<p>Using the Germans as an example, it is possible to illustrate the broad patterns of their migration experience during the nineteenth century. They started to come to the US in large numbers in the 1830s and 1840s, and for each decade from 1850 to 1890, they were the leading immigrant group. The 1890 distribution, as presented on Plate 20, depicts the distribution of Germans by both percentage of total population and density. In general terms, the two distributions are similar with fairly dense population concentrations extending in a wide belt from New York and Pennsylvania in the east to North and South Dakota, Nebraska, and Kansas in the central portion of the country. Smaller pockets are found in Texas and California. Throughout the area, the Germans lived in both rural and urban settlements. However, the Germans are conspicuously absent from the southern states which they avoided because of their opposition to slavery and the lack of economic opportunity before the Civil War (Allen and Turner 1988, 50-55). </p>
<p>The atlas also includes other innovative graphics characterizing the immigrant population. For example, Plate 10 displays a series of pie diagrams showing percentage of foreign born by state. Germans, who were color coded with black, appear to have larger percentages than other immigrant groups in Wisconsin, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, and Missouri. Other immigrant groups, that have the largest percentages in their respective states include Irish (green) in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Delaware; Scandinavians (blue) in Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota, and Canadians in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont. </p>
<p>Another innovative graphic is Plate 43, which presents a series of bar graphs showing occupations subdivided by color and nationality. Native white of native parentage are color coded with light blue; native white of foreign parentage are coded with dark blue. “colored” with dark pink; and foreign white coded with light pink. Germans, who are coded as #3 in the light pink category, have the largest percentages in the occupations of butchers, cigar makers, and tailors. </p>`;

  return `<p>Statistical atlases, such as the one published to illustrate the 1890 Federal census (see Caption 6), provide a national perspective on immigrant populations during the last half of the nineteenth century. However, there are also examples of more specialized studies that document immigrant populations within individual cities. Large-scale thematic maps based on an actual census provide a good source for visualizing the diversity of immigrant populations within individual cities or neighborhoods. One of the first such examples in the United States is a set of maps prepared in the 1890s by residents of Jane Addams’s Hull House in Chicago.</p>
<p>Four maps and ten accompanying essays, contributed by Hull House residents, were published in 1895 as <em>Hull House Maps and Papers</em>. In developing this publication, they utilized data collected from April to July 1893 by US Department of Labor agents for a larger study, <em>A Special Investigation of the Slums of Great Cities</em>. The Chicago portion of this project was directed by Hull House resident, Florence Kelley, who became one of the leading social activists during the Progressive Era (Brown). She was assisted by four agents who collected the data by visiting and inspecting each house, tenement, and room, and often corroborating reports from one person with those from others. Each night, Hull House residents copied the information recorded on the agents’ schedules before they were sent to Washington, DC.</p>
<p>The study area, which was located just to the east of the Hull House, encompassed one third square mile, bordered by Halsted Street on the west, Polk Street on the north, State Street on the east, and 12th Street (Roosevelt Road) on the south. Agnes Sinclair Holbrook, a recent graduate of Wellesley College and also a resident of Hull House, assisted in the compilation of the maps and prepared the introductory essay analyzing the maps (Barnes 1896). She indicated that “the inhabitants, as the maps show, are chiefly foreigners,” and that the study area “includes east of the river a criminal district which ranks as one of the most openly and flagrantly vicious in the civilized world and west of the same stream the poorest, and probably the most crowded section of Chicago.”</p>
<p>In her essay, “Map Notes and Comments,” Miss Holbrook interpreted and analyzed the maps, two of which showed the distribution of nationalities while the other two depicted average wages. She indicated that the maps were inspired by Charles Booth’s wage maps of London, first published in 1889 (Fearon). The two nationality maps, which are illustrated here, were color coded to show the percentage of each nationality residing on an individual city lot, rather than the total number of residents. Consequently, the maps do not reflect density of settlement, but rather the diversity of immigrant populations throughout the study area. Eighteen nationalities were identified in this study area. The largest numbers were Italians (blue), Russian and Polish Jews (red and red stripe), and Bohemians (yellow). Other foreign language groups included Irish (green), Swiss (blue stripe), French (brown), French-Canadian (brown stripe), Greek (olive), Syrian (olive stripe), Chinese (orange), Arabian (orange stripe), and Turkish (white crescent on red). Germans (mauve), who constituted more than a third of Chicago’s population and Scandinavians (yellow stripe), who filled Chicago’s northwest, were not very numerous in this area. The agents also listed English-speaking groups. They were indicated on the map by “black” for African Americans, many of whom migrated from Kentucky and other southern states, and “white” for recent migrants from rural communities in surrounding states, as well as second-generation immigrants who were enrolled in school. In characterizing the spatial distribution of the various nationalities, Holbrook observed that the various nationalities were more or less intermingled, but there was a decided tendency to congregate into small colonies.</p>`;

  return `<p>Throughout the last half of the nineteenth century, German speaking immigrants were the largest group coming into the United States. In addition to their widespread distribution in rural areas throughout the Mid-Atlantic, Midwestern, and Upper Great Plains states, there were also large concentrations, often known as “Little Germanies,” in most Midwestern and Great Lakes cities. Buffalo, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Louisville, St. Louis, Milwaukee, and Chicago all had sizeable German populations (at least twenty percent or greater by 1860).</p>
<p>One example of their urban experience is Chicago, where they constituted the largest immigrant group during the last half of the nineteenth century, comprising one-third of the city’s population. Chicago, founded in 1833, is located on the eastern shore of Lake Michigan, where the city provided a port-of-entry for German immigrants travelling by the Great Lakes into Illinois, Wisconsin, and the Upper Midwest. German settlement began in the 1840s and 1850s, and increased significantly during the last half of the nineteenth century (Harzig).</p>
<p>Large-scale urban atlases, such as fire insurance and real estate atlases, are a good source for identifying and locating key settlement features associated with individual immigrant groups (Karrow and Grim 1990; Grim 1994, 80-84). Prepared to assist insurance underwriters or real estate agents in assessing the risk involved in insuring individual properties or determining the ownership and relative value of individual properties, these maps displayed cartographically a block-by block inventory of buildings in most major cities and towns in the United States during the last third of the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth century. The large-scale maps in these atlases show the footprint of residential, commercial, industrial and public buildings throughout the built-up portions of individual cities. The buildings are color coded to indicate their construction material: Wood (yellow), brick (pink), or stone (brown or blue). Both fire insurance and real estate atlases identify major public buildings, such as churches and schools, as well as industrial buildings. In addition, most real estate atlases indicate the owners’ names for residential properties.</p>
<p>In order to illustrate German settlement in Chicago during the late nineteenth century, four sheets from a five-volume real estate atlas of Chicago published in 1886 by Elisha Robinson are displayed here. Sheets 23, 24, 25, and 26 in volume 3 depict a one-half square mile area, consisting of fifty-five blocks on Chicago’s North Side, an area recognized as one of first German concentrations in the city. The sample area is bounded by Halstead Street on the west, Fullerton Street on the north, Sedgwick Street on the east, and North Street on the south. The map sheets provide substantial evidence of the German presence in this area. Of particular note are three churches and associated schools and social services (St. Michael’s German Roman Catholic Church, Convent, and School; German Evangelical Church and Uhlich Evangelical Lutheran Orphanage; and Second German Baptist Church and School) and two German owned breweries (Bartholomae and Leich Brewing Company and K.C. Schmidt Brewing Company). It was religious, educational, social, industrial, and commercial activities such as these that helped provide cohesive lifestyles for the residents of the Little Germanies that developed in the Midwestern cities during the last half of the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Robinson atlas did not include names of property owners for individual lots, as many real estate atlases do. Thus, other sources, such as manuscript census schedules or city directories, should be consulted to provide a better sense of the size and density of the German population in this neighborhood. A quick survey of <em>Lakeside Annual Directory of the City of Chicago</em> (1881) confirms the large number of German residents in this part of the city. For example, the block of Hurlbut Street (now Cleveland Street) between North Street and Eugenie Street, where St. Michael’s German Roman Catholic Church is located, reveals such family surnames as Mueller, Schaefer, Scharf, Schlem, Schlacht, Schmidt, Schmitz, Wenzel, Wertel, and Wermerskerchen. The variety of occupations listed for these individuals (furniture maker, carpenter, watchmaker, cigar maker, tailor, upholsterer, engraver, printer, machinist, sign painter, dressmaker, trunk maker, teamster, and laborer) suggests a working-class neighborhood. The parallel streets of Mohawk Street and Hudson Street, between North Street and Eugenie Street, as well as many surrounding blocks, display similar patterns confirming the high density of German residents in this sample area.</p>`;

  return `<p>Located on the western bank of the Mississippi River in northeastern Iowa, Guttenberg and the surrounding townships in Clayton County provide an example of a nineteenth century German immigrant community in a rural setting in the Upper Midwest. First settled by German immigrants in the mid-1840s, the community remained predominantly German throughout the nineteenth century, and almost sixty percent of the residents still claim German heritage (Jacobsen 2001). </p>
<p>The settlement was originally known as Prairie La Porte when the Iowa Territory was opened to settlement in the 1830s. It was designated as the county seat of Clayton County in 1838, but quickly lost population after the county seat was moved further inland in 1843. The town was revived when the town plat and an additional 460 acres were sold in 1844 to the Western Settlement Society of Cincinnati, a semi-charitable organization founded to assist German immigration to the Midwest. The first German immigrants arrived the next year, and the town was renamed Guttenberg, most likely in honor of the German printer Johannes Guttenberg. This Mississippi River town prospered and continued to attract German immigrants (Jacobsen 2001; Price 1916). </p>
<p>The town quickly reached a population of one thousand, which it retained until the 1880s when this town map, published on two pages, appeared in the 1886 county land ownership atlas of Clayton County. Landownership atlases such as this one are a good source for identifying immigrant settlement patterns. In this case, the town map for Guttenberg and the township plat for the adjacent rural Jefferson Township provide ample evidence of the almost exclusive German settlement in this area. </p>
<p>The map of Jefferson Township, as is typical of the maps in landownership atlases, delineates the boundaries of individual land holdings, identifies the names of the owners, and lists the acreage in each parcel of land. A cursory examination of the family surnames suggests that many of the landowners in this township were of German ancestry. A review of the forty-three names listed for Jefferson Township in the Patron’s Directory at the conclusion of the atlas indicates that at least thirty (or eighty percent) were of German ancestry. In addition the map locates several rural school houses and cemeteries, as well as one German Catholic Church. </p>
<p>The map of Guttenberg displays the town’s street pattern and the footprints of major buildings, which are identified. It also shows individual residences, but unfortunately the names of landowners are not indicated. However, there is sufficient evidence to suggest heavy German settlement and investment in the community. The map locates two churches in town, which are identified as the German Lutheran and German Catholic Churches. Several industries are also located: A mill south of town on Miners Creek which was associated with lead mining activity, a sawmill on the banks of the Mississippi River, Guttenberg Mills, and three breweries. By comparing these industrial activities to the names listed for the town of Guttenberg in the Patrons Directory, it is evident that all were owned by residents with German ancestry. In fact, of the seventeen entries in the directory, all but one was German. A further indication of the community’s German heritage can be found in the street names. In the southern part of the town, which was the most heavily developed part of town, the streets are named for noted German personalities (Goethe, Herder, Schiller, Lessing, Weiland, Hermann, Koerner), while in the northern part of town the street names reflect American heroes and politicians (Polk, Washington, Jefferson, Lafayette, Jackson, Van Buren), with a few German names interspersed (Mozart, Haydn, Stueben). </p>
<p>The high percentage of German population in the town is also confirmed by a review of the manuscript census schedules for Guttenberg for the United States federal census of 1880 (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210127232728/https://familysearch.org/" rel="nofollow">https://familysearch.org/</a>, searching with name John Wolter). Of 240 households, ninety-four percent of the heads of household were either first or second immigrants from various German states (Bavaria, Mecklenburg, Oldenburg, Hanover, Prussia, Saxony, Hessen, Dortmund, etc.) or other German-speaking countries (Switzerland, Austria, Liechtenstein, and Luxemburg). </p>
<p>While these maps and the associated census records reflect a static picture of the community, each of the families named has a story that reflects its migration patterns. One such example is John Wolter, who is identified as a landowner on both the town map and the adjoining township plat, and is listed in the directory as a “manufacturer of boots and shoes.” According to family tradition and genealogies, he came to the United States from Germany, possibly Bavaria, in 1846. He arrived in New Orleans and worked on Mississippi River boats for three years. Then he bought a farm in southern Illinois, and subsequently settled in Guttenberg, Iowa. Trained as a shoemaker, he started a shoe manufacturing business, obtaining a contract from the Union Army during the Civil War. He prospered and subsequently obtained substantial acreage in the surrounding area; several plots of land are identified on the map of Jefferson Township. He also helped found the Guttenberg State Bank in 1900. He and his wife Sophia (Boehmer), who was born in Westphalia, Germany, were faithful members of the Catholic Church, for which they donated the land for the church and school. They had one daughter and four sons. One son, Francis, stayed in Guttenberg and continued to manage the shoe business, while two of the other sons moved to St. Cloud, Minnesota, and Aberdeen, South Dakota. (Personal communication, January 3, 2014, with John A. Wolter, former Chief, Geography and Map Division, Library of Congress, and great grandson of John Wolter of Guttenberg, Iowa). </p>`;

  return `<p>When discussing the balance of power in the US Congress during the Antebellum period, Civil War historians distinguish between the Free States in the North and Slave States in the South. Using such terminology suggests that slaves, primarily of African American origin, were distributed uniformly throughout the southern states. This visually striking map, which was published in <em>Harper’s Weekly</em>, demonstrates otherwise since it plots the density of African American population in proportion to the white population. Rather than showing a uniform distribution throughout the entire region, it is readily apparent that there were several major slave concentrations, particularly where commercial plantation agriculture was most profitable: Tobacco in the coastal and piedmont regions of Virginia and Maryland; sugar in Louisiana along the lower Mississippi River; and cotton extending in a broad swath from coastal South Carolina, through the piedmont regions of Georgia, Alabama, and the Mississippi River Valley to coastal Texas. The accompanying article explains that some of the areas with the lightest shading had slave densities of less than three percent. On the other hand, many of the areas with the darkest shading had densities of fifty to sixty percent, while a few counties long the South Carolina coast and along the Mississippi River in Louisiana and Mississippi had densities of over ninety percent. </p>
<p>This map is representative of some of the first statistical or thematic maps published in the United States. Published in <em>Harper’s Weekly</em> for a general audience, it was most likely adapted from a more statistical cartographic representation, published by the US Coast Survey in 1861 (Hergesheimer 1861). Using data from the 1860 census, that map plotted slave percentages by county, rather than using gradual shading to portray increasing densities. It was drawn by Edwin Hergesheimer, a recent German immigrant who was employed as the Coast Survey’s Chief Draftsman. In addition, a statement boldly positioned at the map’s top center, stating that it was sold for the benefit of the US Army’s sick and wounded soldiers, suggests that it reflected the interests of Alexander Dallas Bache, the Survey’s Superintendent. Bache was an ardent abolitionist and had just become vice president of the US Sanitary Commission. Attesting to this map’s importance during the Civil War, it was intentionally depicted in Francis Bicknell Carpenter’s oil painting, <em>First Reading of the Emancipation Proclamation of President Lincoln</em>, which hangs in the US Capitol Senate wing. The artist’s memoir records Abraham Lincoln’s fascination with the map, not just for its symbolic power and visual appeal, but because it allowed him to trace military movements, and to relate those actions to his emancipation policies (Schulten 2011). </p>
<p>Despite the cartographic differences of these two maps, both reflect the culmination of the African-Americans’ 250-year migration history to North America and geographical spread within the United States before emancipation and the abolition of slavery. This involuntary migration began with the first importation of African slaves into Virginia in 1619. During the remainder of the seventeenth century, African slavery gradually replaced white indentured servitude as the primary labor source for commercial plantation agriculture in the southern colonies. The importation of African slaves continued throughout the eighteenth century, with many slaves coming directly from Africa, but even more re-imported from the Caribbean after several years of seasoning on the West Indian sugar plantations. In the years following the American Revolution, many northern states abolished slavery and in 1808, the United States outlawed the international importation of slaves. However the domestic sale of slaves continued during the first half of the nineteenth century. With the invention of the cotton gin and the spread of cotton production from the Carolina Low Country, to Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Texas, slavery quickly spread across the southeastern United States as documented on these two maps (Grim and Block, 72-73). </p>`;

  return `<p>Because most African Americans came to the United States through the institution of chattel slavery, their migration history before the Civil War was primarily a forced experience. Their journey began with passage on crowded slave ships across the Atlantic Ocean from the West Coast of Africa to South America, the Caribbean Islands, and/or the southeastern United States. Their ability to move freely and widely within the United States was fairly limited to the communities surrounding the plantations and farms where their owners lived. Only when their owners moved westward or when they were sold to other plantation owners, did their geographical location change. However, as the abolition movement grew in strength during the first half of the nineteenth century, a number of slaves did exercise some free will by escaping from slavery through the process that came to be known as the Underground Railroad. While it is not known how many slaves escaped to freedom, the estimates range as high as 100,000 (US National Park Service 1998). </p>
<p>The Underground Railroad was neither a railroad nor did it have established routes. Rather it was a complex network based on many sympathetic people working to assist slaves in moving toward freedom. Because the Underground Railroad was a secret and illegal operation, there were no contemporary maps to guide those who escaped or that depict the full extent of this complex communication network. However, historians have been able to document “stations” or places that assisted runaway slaves and the major routes that were travelled, based on oral histories gathered from abolitionists who assisted escapees and slaves who reached freedom. </p>
<p>One of the first attempts to write such a history of the Underground Railroad and to map its geographic components was that of Wilbur Siebert, who published the results of his research in The <em>Underground Railroad: From Slavery to Freedom</em> (New York: Macmillan, 1899). Based on research that he conducted in the early 1890s while teaching United States history at Ohio State University, he was able to compile a map of the eastern half of the United States, providing the first comprehensive depiction of the various routes involved in the Underground Railroad. In commenting on his research methods, Siebert indicated that he was able to create this representation “by piecing together the scraps of information in regard to various routes and parts of routes gathered from the reminiscences of a large number of abolitionists.” </p>
<p>It is evident from his cartographic depiction that there were many recorded journeys generally in a south to north direction, both by land and sea, through all of the states north of the Ohio River and the Mason and Dixon Line, the boundary between Slave and Free territory, with an ultimate goal of reaching Canada which presented a safe haven for escaping slaves. Although there was heavy traffic along the routes from Virginia and Maryland north through Pennsylvania and New York to the New England states, the Midwestern states of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois were dotted with a myriad of stations and connected by zigzagging routes. For example in Illinois, many of the routes began in the southwestern part of the state along the Mississippi River, which was the shared boundary with Missouri where slavery was still legal. These routes tended to converge on Chicago, where escapees often found passage on vessels sailing on the Great Lakes to Canadian ports, primarily in Ontario. </p>
<p>Numerous modern maps also depict the Underground Railroad showing only broad general lines of movement (Grim and Block 2011, 76-77). However, one modern reconstruction, titled <em>Freedom’s Tracks: A Map the Underground Railroad</em> (McElfresh 2005), attempts to present as comprehensive as possible a depiction of the great number of routes, stations, and destinations. This colorful and detailed presentation is based on extensive research including Seibert’s history and accompanying maps, and a manuscript map that was compiled in the early 1940s from slave narratives collected and recorded during the 1930s (Federal Writers Project 1941). </p>`;

  return `<p>Representative of the genre of mid- nineteenth century state maps often titled as “township” or “sectional” maps, this is one of many such maps published for Kansas and Nebraska during the 1850s and 1860s. Such “township” maps, which were published for many Midwestern states, were produced by commercial firms, but were based on official government township surveys conducted by the US General Land Office (Grim 1987, Grim 1990). They showed the progress of land surveys, almost on a yearly basis, and were issued to promote land sales and settlement in individual states. As such, they reflect the general westward migration of the American population from the eastern seaboard to the Midwestern and Great Plains states. </p>
<p>However, this map, which was published in Boston rather than New York City or Philadelphia where the cartographic publishing industry was centered during the first half of the nineteenth century, provides documentation of two other migration trends in nineteenth century United States. While the western migration was primarily a voluntary movement, the other two were forced migrations: The removal of the Native Americans from their ancestral lands and the spread of African-American slavery from its core in the southern states. </p>
<p>The Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854 established two new territories with a provision that settlers would decide whether they entered the Union as free or slave states. This legislation negated the 1820 Missouri Compromise which previously designated Latitude 36˚ 30’ (the southern boundary of Missouri) as the dividing line between free and slave states in the western territories. </p>
<p>As eastern Kansas was settled during the 1850s, intense competition and armed conflict developed between the proslavery and antislavery (free state) factions. With the violence lasting from 1854-1858, the territory was commonly known as “Bloody Kansas.” Proslavery settlers moved from neighboring Missouri which permitted slavery, while groups such as the Massachusetts-based New England Emigrant Aid Company promoted antislavery settlement. Lawrence, Kansas, a center of antislavery activity, was named for noted philanthropist and abolitionist Amos Adams Lawrence, the company’s secretary. His father and uncle were influential in developing the New England textile industry, particularly in Lowell and Lawrence, Massachusetts. </p>
<p>Reflecting its Boston and New England biases, this 1856 map subtly highlights the conflict. While the map’s primary purpose was to delineate newly surveyed lands in eastern Kansas that were opened for settlement, the marginal illustrations underscore the publisher’s free state sympathies. For example, one illustration depicts the ruins of Lawrence’s Eldridge Hotel, a haven for free-state emigrants. It was destroyed in 1856 by proslavery “border ruffians” from Missouri. Another illustration depicts Topeka’s Constitution Hall, where “free-staters” drafted an antislavery constitution (Grim and Block 2011, 84-85). Also depicted at three locations along the Kansas River are three encampments labeled “Shannon’s Posse, December 10, 1855,” referring to territorial governor Wilson Shannon’s attempts to intervene in the Wakarusa War, one of the initial conflicts between the proslavery and free-state factions. </p>
<p>This map also provides a single snap shot of Native American forced migration history. At least a dozen Indian reservations are delineated, including lands set aside for the Wyandotte, Shawnee, Peoria, Kaskaskia, Chippewa, Ottawa, Miami, Sac and Fox, Pottawattamie, Kansas, Delaware, and Kickapoo. These reservations are highlighted with pastel shades of pink, blue, and yellow, suggesting that these were areas that were not open to White settlement. In tracing the origins of these Native groups, it is evident that most of them had been resettled here in the 1830s from lands further east in areas that became the Midwestern states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin. However, as Kansas Territory was rapidly settled during the 1850s, these lands were also ceded to the Federal government, and the Native groups were forced to relocate again, this time to the Indian Territory, which eventually became part of the state of Oklahoma. </p>`;

  return `<p>Two woodcuts illustrating the pamphlet <em>De Insulis nuper inuentis</em> (1494) were among the first “maps” offering visual evidence of the existence of a new-found world. They were published in 1493 inside a pamphlet containing Latin translations of three letters sent by Christopher Columbus (1451-1506) to the Spanish Court in which he announced the discovery of islands in what he wrongly believed to be the Sea of India and thus the gateway to Cathay (China).</p>
<p>Drawn in the tradition of late medieval landscape art—and thus devoid of modern notions of proportion, scale, and the rules of perspective—the two illustrations offer complementary views of Columbus approaching America as a geographical place, travel destination, and human habitat. The illustration on the right shows Columbus’s ship, the Santa Maria, as a multi-oared Mediterranean galley at anchor in the foreground; on the illustration’s center right, the artist shows Columbus, standing up in a row boat, approaching the island of Haiti (“Insula Hyspana”) and on the way of making contact with a group of disproportionately drawn figures representing Native Americans. The second illustration on the left offers a cartographic overview of the islands discovered and named by Columbus. They include Fernada, Hyspana, Ysabella, Saluatorie, and Conceptionis Marie.</p>
<p>The eight-page pamphlet was an immediate bestseller. Between Spanish and Latin editions, and Tuscan and German translations, it is estimated that some ten thousand copies of the illustrations were available to a literate minority within only five years of his voyage. Reflecting the artistry of untravelled artists who created map-like representations by following medieval conventions for depicting natural and human spaces, the illustrations proved to be highly influential, celebrating Columbus’s claim to have found a passage to China while providing first visual clues to a mostly illiterate European audience about previously unknown American lands and peoples.</p>`;

  return `<p>This map by the English mercenary and expedition leader, Captain John Smith (1580-1631), was made several years before the first wave of English colonists arrived in Plymouth, Massachusetts. Since then it has become one of the more iconic early American maps because it gave New England its name; moreover, it was the first to provide a recognizably modern depiction of the region. Stretching north from Cape Cod (“Cape James”) to Penobscot Bay (“Pembrocks Bay”), the coastline is dotted with locales today known as Plymouth Bay, the Charles River, Cape Ann, Cape Elizabeth, and Falmouth Harbor. </p>
<p>Showing almost no inland detail, the map was primarily the result of Smith’s 2,000-mile coastal journey during which, as Smith writes, “I haue drawen a Map from Point to Point, Ile to Ile, and Harbour to Harbour, with the Soundings, Sands, Rocks, &amp; Land-marks as I passed close aboard the Shore in a little Boat; although there be many things to bee obserued which the haste of other affaires did cause me omit: for, being sent more to get present commodities, then knowledge by discoueries for any future good, I had not power to search as I would: yet it will serue to direct any shall goe that waies, to safe Harbours and the Saluages habitations: What marchandize and commodities for their labour they may finde, this following discourse shall plainely demonstrate” (Smith, <em>Description</em> 20). </p>
<p>Smith’s map design had much in common with the genres of sea charts and pilot maps. A crisscross network of rhumb lines (lines marking a ship’s intended path based on a defined bearing) provided direction for future navigators looking for coastal features, including river mouths, inlets, and islands. The map also functioned as a promotional map, advertising New England as an Anglophone cultural landscape. Containing place names like “Plymouth” or “Oxford,” it gave the impression of an extensive and thriving English colony, even though in 1616 the “towns” were purely fictitious. Published inside Smith’s promotional pamphlet <em>A Description of New England</em> (1616), which was intended to stimulate colonization in the region, the map in all likelihood informed Puritan leaders who were preparing their exodus to the New World, including John Endecott and John Winthrop, the first two governors of the Massachusetts Bay Colony.</p>`;

  return `<p>Throughout the seventeenth century, many maps gave the impression that America was not a continent in the tectonic sense of the term but a loosely configured archipelago of islands ranging in size from Barbados to South America. This kind of perspective was the result of mapmakers who drafted maps to reflect the economic reality of transatlantic traffic patterns, trade routes, and trading posts. Select overview maps connecting the Eastern with the Western hemispheres specialized in the depiction of the trade triangle in which European ships traveled to African markets with manufactured goods; these goods were traded for purchased or kidnapped people from Africa; the African prisoners were then transported across the Atlantic as slaves (the infamous “middle passage”); once in America, the slaves were then sold or traded for raw materials, which would be transported back to Europe to complete the triangular cycle of transatlantic commerce. </p>
<p>Having lost his fortune during the English Civil Wars, Richard Ligon (1585?-1662) left England in 1648 to gain his fortune in the New World where he spent two years on the Caribbean island of Barbados, one of America’s most profitable colonies in the sugar trade. While the narrative of Ligon’s <em>History</em> (1657) traced the triangular trade (consisting of English goods, slaves, and sugar), his large foldout map concentrated on the island itself. A reproduction of Captain John Swan’s 1638 map, Ligon’s version continued to identify nearly three hundred plantations by their owners’ names, the majority of which were located along the island’s coast. </p>
<p>Drawn in a pictographic style that echoed Smith’s map of New England, Ligon’s map suggested limited mobility within the island’s interior, which the map rendered optically inaccessible by showing forests, mountains, and wild beasts. Strategically placed vignettes depict planters hunting wild pigs or chasing runaway slaves. Surprisingly, Ligon also inserted a pair of camels on which he commented that “these are very useful beasts, but very few will live upon the Island; divers [planters] have had them brought over, but few know how to diet them.” Showing the lack of waterways or developed road systems, the map’s inclusion of images depicting four different types of sailing vessels reminded readers that the sea rather than land offered the better path of transportation.</p>`;

Notorious for extending the southern colonies across the entire continent, even stretching across established Spanish territory west of the Mississippi, this map has been mostly treated as a political map with blatant pro-British and propagandistic visual content. For example, aside from claiming most of the southern half of the North American continent for the British, the map drastically reduced the French-owned territory by dividing up the Iroquois territories between the colonies of Virginia and New York (he understood them to reach from Lake Champlain to the Mississippi, and north of Lake Superior). Similarly, many of the map’s extensive notes about boundaries and land charters misstate international treaties or were Mitchell’s fabrications favoring British territorial interests. </p>
<p>However, what is often overlooked is that the Mitchell map offered one of the first comprehensive overviews of turnpikes and long-distance roads. Designed as a large wall map—when fully assembled the map is about six and a half feet wide and four and a half feet tall—it contains many textual inserts describing and explaining features about the natural resources and potential for settlement of frontier regions unknown to most colonists, not to mention European politicians. In this context the Mitchell map not only shows many Indian settlements along with important Indian trails, but major overland roads, marked by single-stroked and double-stroked lines, connecting coastal cities with continental settlements. Of course, many of these roads would have been frequently indistinguishable from Indian trails, and at times existed only in the imagination of the mapmaker. But they give the illusion of an extensive and secure transportation network because they linked, as listed by the map’s legend, “Cities and Capitals,” “Towns,”… “Indian Villages,”… and “Forts.” Subsequently, the map was consulted by American land companies interested in staking out land claims beyond the Appalachian Mountains as well as by future travelers and writers, like Andrew Burnaby, John Filson, or Thomas Jefferson, who were interested in exploring the continental hinterland.</p>`;

  return `<p>This hand-colored map by Amos Doolittle (1754-1832), a Boston engraver and silversmith, was one of the first national maps published in the United States immediately following the 1783 Peace of Paris that ended the Revolutionary War and guaranteed independence for the United States. Conceived as a fold-out map to be inserted into the nation’s first bestselling geography schoolbook, Jedidiah Morse’s <em>Geography Made Easy</em> (1784), this map reached thousands of citizens, young and old alike, during the first decades after Independence. </p>
<p>Unlike previous maps showing geopolitical sections of North America, the Doolittle map is designed to present exclusively the territory of the nation-state. It therefore traces the international borders from the Atlantic Ocean in the east to the Mississippi River in the west, and from British Canada to the north and Spanish Florida to the South. At the same time it provides information about the interior, which, despite being rudimentary, offered Americans a first synoptic view of the union. Later national maps, often conceived as giant wall maps, were much more detailed. Combined with the textual apparatus and reading protocols of school geographies, these maps accompanied lessons in which students learned how to travel the nation in the virtual setting of a map: Oral recitation required students to match locations on the map with encyclopedic entries describing the geography of the land, rivers, and settlements. </p>
<p>Prefacing the map at the lower right is an ornamental cartouche that introduces through its visual narrative the relationship between map and literary mapping. Hovering in a swirl of billowing clouds, the female figure of Liberty (or Columbia) lifts, together with the help of the American eagle, a banner inscribed with the words “Aspera ad Astra”—which translates as “a rough road leads to the stars”—in order to unveil the new nation’s name (in bold print) while the land is shown beneath (in a pictorial sketch). When considered in juxtaposition to the map image, the cartouche suggests that as long as they are viewed separately the two discursive modes of either word or image will foster imaginings that are easily clouded and distorted. If used jointly, however—as the dual gesture of unveiling the geographic name of the nation and of the map image itself indicates—the cartouche celebrates the mixed language of the map as the ideal literary means for representing and traveling the nation in clear and unambiguous terms.</p>`;

  return `<p>After moving to Michigan in 1821 to teach at the newly founded university, John Farmer (1798-1859) is today credited for having produced about a dozen maps responsible for promoting the settlement of Michigan between 1825 and 1840. Several generations of travelers plotted out routes and staked out land claims using his maps that presented the areas of Michigan, Wisconsin, Lake Superior, and the city of Detroit. Farmer’s <em>Improved Map of the Territories of Michigan and Ouisconsin</em>, applying a uniquely slanted orientation, provides a complete overview of the territories under Michigan’s jurisdiction while also anticipating Michigan’s impending statehood and separation from the western areas (which the map’s caption declares to “be shortly set off as Ouisconsin”). </p>
<p>What made Farmer’s map so appealing to prospective emigrants—including perhaps the writer Caroline Kirkland—is its detailed references to roads, waterways, and towns. These are supplemented by line markings showing the routes taken by the geologists, Henry Schoolcraft and Lewis Cass who explored the Lake Superior region, as well as Stephen Long’s route in search of the source of the Mississippi River. The prominent display of township and range lines, not to mention the coloring of counties, provides at least three impressions, namely that the map was a reliable wayfinding tool, that large parts of the Michigan territory were surveyed according to the federal Land Ordinance Acts, and that the rectangular land lots were recorded by the General Land Office (an independent agency of the US government created in 1812 and in charge of lands in the public domain). </p>
<p>Also of interest to emigrants traveling to the Michigan territory would have been the map’s information about the Native American population, and thus about prospective threats to economic activities and personal safety. Farmer’s map identifies native villages, Indian agencies, and abandoned trading posts. Like many earlier maps intended to promote regions in America, Farmer embellished the map with a little bit of speculative cartography. While not promising the location of a northwestern El Dorado, the map perpetuates the myth of rich mineral deposits, consisting of copper and lead, in the western valley of the Blue Earth River (near today’s Minneapolis, Minn.)</p>`;

  return `<p>A prolific publisher, James T. Lloyd was one of the more ambitious producers of commercial maps during the late 1850s and 1860s. Before the onset of the Civil War, Lloyd specialized in river maps of the west. Designed in the fashion of the “strip” or “ribbon” map used since the seventeenth century for charting travel routes on land and water, the map showing the lower Mississippi River was the product of the cooperation between the publisher Lloyd, the Topographical Bureau of Washington DC, and two experienced river pilots, Captains Bart and William Bowen. As a result of this collaboration, the map offered American travelers highly detailed information about the river’s physical geography (sandbars, islands, bluffs, bayous, cut-offs), its commercial geography (sugar and cotton plantations, cities, towns, fortifications), and transportation geography (the steamboat channel, landings, mileage, nearby railroads and roads). Because the ribbon format compressed the representation of the river onto one sheet of paper, a traveler holding this map—a pocket edition that cost two dollars—would have been able to follow a boat’s journey from St. Louis to the Gulf of Mexico in increments of five miles per inch.</p>
<p>Interesting to students of American literature, the map was a sequel to Lloyd’s previously published sensationalistic collection, <em>Lloyd’s Steamboat Directory, and Disasters on the Western Waters</em> (1856). This volume contained a hodgepodge of stories ranging from the “History of the First Application of Steam, as a Motive of Power” and the “Lives of John Fitch and Robert Fulton” to the “History of the Early Steamboat Navigation on Western Waters” and the “Full Accounts of all the Steamboat Disasters Since the First Application of Steam Down to the Present Date”—including also “One Hundred Fine Engravings, and Sixty Maps.” With a volume like this Lloyd sought to capitalize on the nation’s fascination with the Mississippi River as a unique setting that, similar to the frontier setting of the West, harbored the potential for economic opportunity, excessive violence, and social experiments.</p>`;

  return `<p>The maps illustrating Hezekiah Butterworth’s (1839–1905) young adult fiction are diverse, ranging from travel maps to outline maps to archeological charts. In his <em>Zig-Zag Journeys in the Western States of America</em> (1884), graphic designers used segments of railroad maps for illustrating the volume’s front- and back-papers. Railroad maps had a distinct look because they privileged information pertaining either to the railroad network or to a particular railroad company. Thus they showed stations, intersections, and depots but excluded other mappable transportation networks, such turnpikes and canals, not to mention topographical features like mountains or rivers. As shown by the decorative map segments, railroad maps also display transportation patterns of different density; while line markings document the various train tracks and circles the stations, their size and thickness distinguished primary from secondary train lines. </p>
<p>When compared to the rest of the endpapers’ illustrations, the map segments serve as visual substitutes for images showing actual train engines; all other modes of transportation are depicted in realistic drawings, including horse, oxcart, and steamboat. The book illustrator thus anticipated Butterworth’s narrative plot. On one hand, it emphasizes the speed of trains. On the other hand, it documents a rather unevenly paced journey across the west, jumping from episode to episode, as if imitating a train’s rushed journey along the prescribed path of railroad tracks, only to be interrupted by scheduled stops during which passengers (or readers) can examine and reflect on their environment. The illustrator’s choice of map segments furthermore resembles not only the ribbon design of nineteenth-century river maps but the cartographic views offered by today’s handheld electronic devices, such as a GPS device, both of which emphasize transportation routes over other geographic content. </p>
<p>Butterworth’s <em>Zig-Zag Journeys in the Western States of America</em> was one of eighteen volumes published between 1879 and 1896, selling for a total of over 250,000 copies. Each volume addressed a young male audience; each volume emphasized a different mode of transportation; and equipped with a distinct cover design and title logo, each volume of the <em>Zig-Zag Journeys</em> offered young adults fantasies of geographic mobility.</p>`;

  return `<p>Maps navigating fictional worlds, while rare compared to maps appending travel literature, have been a staple of the American reading experience since the eighteenth century. Since the arrival of copies containing Daniel Defoe’s <em>Robinson Crusoe</em> (1719-20), American readers encountered fold-out and insert maps illustrating imaginary journeys and cartographic views of fictional islands and continents, counties and even whole worlds. Early fictional maps were available for classics such as John Bunyan’s <em>Pilgrim’s Progress</em> (c. 1678; 1778) and Jonathan Swift’s <em>Gulliver’s Travels</em> (1726). More familiar today are the maps illustrating Frank Baum’s <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> (1900), William Faulkner’s <em>Absalom, Absalom!</em> (1936), J. R. R. Tolkien’s <em>The Hobbit</em> (1937) and <em>The</em> <em>Lord of the Rings</em> trilogy (1954-55), not to mention book-related maps such as the those prefacing C. S. Lewis’s “Narnia” series and J. K. Rowling’s “Marauder’s Map” made famous in <em>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</em> (1999).</p>
<p>William Reed’s volume, <em>The Phantom of the Poles</em> (1906), a cross between pseudoscience and science fiction, seeks to explain geological and atmospheric phenomena observed by polar explorers by arguing that the Earth is hollow and that its insides are accessible through gigantic holes at either pole. The much-publicized expeditions by Admiral Robert Peary (1909) and Roald Amundson (1911) soon debunked the myth of the holes, and along with it the hollow-earth theory. However, Reed’s imaginary map of the hollow earth continues to inform modern science fiction in which book illustrators, through the use of a few cartographic symbols, easily invoke both the authority of the map as a tool of scientific representation and subsequently the authenticity of an imaginary underground geography, here consisting of oceans, continents, and even the opportunity of travel (see the sailing vessel at the map’s upper center).</p>`;

  return `<p>A Rand McNally road map, like this one from 1954 showing the western states of Arizona and New Mexico, was an iconic object of US culture representing the rise of the automobile as the dominant mode of travel. Moreover, between the Second World War and the advent of electronic navigation systems (GPS), the Rand McNally road map emerged as a ubiquitous artifact: Sold at gas stations or given out for free by automobile clubs, it informed everyday life while also signifying mobility from the social and professional to the personal and recreational. In design similar to nineteenth-century railroad maps, the road map prioritizes streets, roads, and highways. The roads are color-coded, numbered, and ranked according to levels of national importance from the federally funded highway to the local country lane. Here “red highways” stand for transregional traffic arteries connecting different states, while “blue highways” mark local road systems fanning across the countryside. </p>
<p>While copies of Rand McNally road maps were not included into copies of American literature, their presence is implied in fiction and biographies written between the 1920s and 1980s. The road map provides an implied narrative horizon in F. Scott Fitzgerald’s short story “The Diamond as Big as the Ritz” (1922) and his classic novel, <em>The Great Gatsby</em> (1925). It informs the movements taken by the characters in John Dos Passos’s <em>Manhattan Transfer</em> (1925) and acclaimed <em>USA Trilogy</em> (1933-36). Its presence is felt in John Steinbeck’s <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em> (1936) and its realistic depiction of the exodus of the “Okies” during the 1930s Dust Bowl. While the road map informed modernist novels exploring the theme of mobility in lives lived in luxury or poverty, its influence can be further felt in the works of the Beatnik generation, such as Jack Kerouac’s <em>On the Road</em> (1957) and Tom Wolfe’s <em>The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test</em> (1968). But the road map’s most lasting influence lay in its power of inspiring countless road and camping trips undertaken by the American middle class—from the family vacation to the teenager’s existential journey across the continent—who, with map in hand, experienced the American landscape from behind windshields following models laid out by Steinbeck’s travelogue <em>Travels with Charlie: In Search of America</em> (1968), Robert Pirsig’s <em>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance: An Inquiry into Values</em> (1974), and William Least Heat Moon’s <em>Blue Highways</em>: <em>A Journey into America</em> (1982).</p>`;

  return `<p>One of the most important technologies in the history of maritime navigation is the compass, a device based on the fact that the earth has a distinct magnetic field, and that magnetized materials will tend to line up in parallel to the lines of the local magnetic field. Sometime around 1000 CE, magnetic needle compasses that could be used on ships were developed in China, and spread rapidly around the world. From the beginning, it was noted that compass needles pointed only generally north and south, and that the difference in direction, or deviation, of the compass needle changed slowly as one traveled. With further experience with compasses, it was realized that the deviation of a compass that never moved from one spot changed as well, although very slowly. </p>
<p>In 1701, Edmund Halley synthesized his own observations of the deviation of the compass over the expanse of the South Atlantic ocean, and combined them with the observations of the much more frequently traveled North Atlantic, to create what is in some ways a three-dimensional model of the earth’s magnetic field, in which the major lines of magnetic force above the planet are projected down onto the surface. Halley developed the very first isogonic lines to represent the deviation of the magnetic field from true north-south orientation. The central undulating line represents the thin zone where compass needles actually do point north-south. West of that line, compass needles point east of north, and east of the line compass needles point west of true north. All points along any of Halley’s isogonic lines will have the same deviation from true north-south. </p>
<p>There are small steady changes in deviation over years everywhere, called secular variation. It is conjectured that the slow circulation of molten metal in the earth’s core and aesthenosphere are the causes of secular variation. Several decades after the publication of his first map, secular variation had changed enough that Halley researched and then published a revised second edition of his map, in 1732. </p>`;

  return `<p>Sometime around 1800, Edmund Blunt began a partnership with Nathaniel Bowditch (1773-1838) who was a mathematical prodigy and master of navigational sciences born into an ancient seafaring family in Salem, Massachusetts. They schemed to create a new, improved edition of another British navigational authority, <em>The New Practical Navigator, being an Epitome of Navigation</em>, which had been written by John Hamilton Moore (1738-1807), who was a skilled British mathematician and innovator in navigational techniques. Captain Lawrence Furlong’s <em>American Coast Pilot</em> was primarily addressed to coast-wise navigation along the American coast, and the intricacies of sailing in and out of complex harbor channels, etc. Moore’s <em>Epitome of Navigation</em> was a general treatise on celestial navigation, determining latitude and longitude at sea by reference to astronomical positioning, and particularly to improved methods to determine a ship’s longitude, by use of tables of the projected positions of the Moon at specific future times and dates as experienced at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich. </p>
<p>Blunt and Bowditch’s Chart of the Atlantic Ocean features a compass rose in the approximate center of the Western Ocean, or North Atlantic. The chart also has some arrows showing consistent ocean current direction, and a great arc, named as “The Trade Wind” which is more accurately described as the course of the Gulf Steam flowing from the south and then east towards the coast of northwestern Europe. The chart also shows the track of a ship’s voyage from Boston Harbor into and along the great arc, and then directly east to the Portuguese island of Madeira, southwest of the Iberian Peninsula. That journey was accompanied by a complete journal of the process of navigating from Boston to Madeira, written to illustrate most or all of the navigational techniques presented by Bowditch. In that era, there were copyright laws in force in both Great Britain and the United States, although they varied from our present legal conceptions of copyright a good deal. But in any case, a way of making the case that a new edition of somebody else’s book didn’t violate copyrights to the book was to make additions and improvements to it. The original British editions of Moore’s <em>New Practical Navigator</em> taught his navigational techniques through a journal of a voyage from London to the island of Tenerife, in the Canary Islands off the coast from the western Sahara in Africa. Bowditch’s version voyaged from Boston to Madeira, and hence was “new, and improved!” </p>
<p>The 1807 edition of “the Bowditch” also includes illustrations of the three major instruments of navigation as used in the western tradition in that era: (1) The mariners compass, with its thirty-two-point divisions, the compass rose, here mounted on gimbals in a box, to compensate for the rocking movements of the ship; (2) Equipment to determine the speed of the ship, consisting of an hourglass for timing, and a spool on which line can be wound, and a “log,” which when thrown overboard off the back end of the ship attached to the line, will tend to stay in the same place in the water, while the ship moves forward and the line runs out, until the moment the hourglass empties. The length of the line unrolled during the time of the hourglass can then be converted into an estimate of the speed of the ship; and (3) Two versions of the general class of angle-measuring instruments called, generally, quadrants. Isaac Newton (1642-1727) actually devised the concept for a celestial angle measuring device using double-reflecting mirrors, a description of which he gave to Edmond Halley. This was not published until after Halley’s death in 1742, by which time a British mathematician, John Hadley (1682-1744), and an American optician and inventor, Thomas Godfrey (1704-1749) had, about 1730, independently invented their own versions of the instrument. Well into the next century, the instruments were commonly known as Hadley’s quadrants. In the Bowditch image, the instrument on the left is described as a quadrant, although it is more properly an octant, as its curved arc represents an eighth of a circle, or forty-five degrees. The instrument in the right is a sextant, with an arc of sixty degrees, or a sixth of a circle. With this general class of instrument, it is possible to measure the angle between two celestial objects reasonably accurately, by day or night, from the deck of a moving ship, which is an extraordinary achievement. This triad of instrument systems for determining the direction, speed, and position of a ship became universal in the western traditions of navigation until the twentieth century and the advent of radio systems and electronic instruments. Even now, in the absence of electronics, the triad still works well. </p>`;

The triangular shape of the sails in the engraving signifies that these ships were designed to sail partially into the direction of the wind. No ship can sail directly into the direction of the wind, but it is quite possible to sail at a certain small angle to the wind’s direction, then turn to sail at a small angle to the wind on the other side, and hence to zig-zag back and forth but progressing steadily in the direction the wind is coming from. This maneuver, called “tacking,” which is actually predicated on specific shapes and characteristics of the ship’s hull, in addition to the design of the sails and the rigging to hold them up, opened the great world oceans to human exploration. </p>
<p>The next major development in coast-wise and maritime navigation is actually one of the most important developments on this subject in human history: Ship propulsion by non-human power. Until about the 1780s, all coast-wise and maritime navigation involved boats and ships like those in Plate One, propelled by human labor, and/or wind and currents. With the invention of steam engines, originally designed for very terrestrial work in mines and quarries, it soon became clear that propulsion of boats and ships by engines would transform travel over water. After many failed or unsatisfactory attempts, inventors on all sides of the Atlantic Ocean developed successful steam-powered craft in the 1780s. Steamboats began in coast-wise navigation, as the early ones weren’t capable of voyaging on the open ocean. Rapid improvements in all aspects of the ships’ design, as well as improvements in engines, soon changed this. The steamboat presented in Abraham Rees’s <em>Cyclopaedia</em> in 1819 was designed for use in relatively shallow and relatively calm water, as in a lake or on canals, or coastal waters, indicated by the flat keel and propulsion by paddle wheel, which limits contact with rocks and so on at depth, and the relatively wide deck. The craft appears to be a passenger-carrying vessel, with cabins with lots of windows and a fenced deck for sightseeing. Notice the hybrid nature of the vessel, combining the latest technology, a steam engine, with square sails for sailing with the wind, the very oldest type of sail. Below the boat are two different steam engine designs, both of which turn the energy released in steam into revolutions of a giant wheel, from which different applications can take off power for different purposes. </p>`;

  return `<p>The <em>Travelers Pocket Map of Ohio with its canals, roads and distances, by stage &amp; steam boat routes</em> may seem anomalous in an essay on coast-wise and maritime navigation, but it is closely related to what came before, and reflects the fresh transformations in travel by boat and ship underway. All steam engines required fuel for their boilers and clean water for steam. The engines were made primarily of iron and steel, and slowly more and more ships were “iron-bottomed” too. Close available stocks of firewood and iron ore and coal were rapidly depleted, leading to a relentless search for these resources ever farther away. The “inland seas” of the Great Lakes, in particular, offered ships access to vast stores of metal ores, coal, chemicals and salts necessary to the Industrial Revolution. But there were choke-points on the waterways, particularly rapids and waterfalls, like Niagara Falls. The solution was to build canals around obstructions, and canals to supply more direct access to sources of bulk commodities, and link them to river transport, and ever larger steam ships on the Great Lakes. All these systems ultimately were connected to the maritime shipping systems previously developed. Hence it made perfect commercial sense for Edmund Blunt the Elder, the publisher of the <em>American Coast Pilot</em> and the <em>New American Practical Navigator</em>, to publish a guide to roads and canals in Ohio, and the shipping routes of bordering Lake Erie, and to do so in the form of a small, convenient pocket-sized volume. </p>`;

  return `<p>In 1807, Ferdinand Hassler (1770-1843), a Swiss immigrant scientist, successfully persuaded President Thomas Jefferson to use this technique for the American Survey of the Coast, authorized by Congress. The Survey’s early history was rocky and contentious, but by about 1834 Hassler’s system was deployed in force. Four years later, in 1838, the Coast Survey commissioned a commercial printer to produce the very first chart of the Survey of the Coast, New Haven Harbor. This harbor chart is very provisional compared to charts of a decade later, but Hassler’s methods are clearly displayed. Hassler pioneered working simultaneously on mapping the topography of the land, and the hydrography of the waters, tying them both together through the same sets of signal flags mounted along the shore. The spider webs of lines of number in the harbor are the lines of travel of the hydrographic boats, with the position of the numbers representing the horizontal positions of the boats, and the numbers themselves represent the depths of the water at precisely those spots. The marshes, woodlands, farmed fields and houses on the land were positioned by the same triangulation process as used for the hydrography, and topography and hydrography ultimately controlled horizontally by the master geodetic network Hassler established. There were two systems for vertical heights and depths, both based on the tidal systems of the harbor. The legend reports “the greatest tide observed in two Lunations,” or two complete lunar months, which gives some indication of the length of their fieldwork at the harbor. Heights on the land were based on a level of mean high tide, so that everything above that level was “land”, at least most of the time. The hydrographic depths were based on the level of mean low tide, so that depths mapped were at least that deep, most of the time. With a few changes and improvements, Hassler’s methodologies displayed in the New Haven harbor chart continued for most of the next century, until airplanes and aerial photography, and boats equipped with sonar depth finders changed nautical charting again.</p>`;

  return `<p>By the middle of the nineteenth century Western ships and their crews were sailing and steaming in all oceans and almost all coasts, except for the shores of Antarctica. Popular and scientific interest in these voyages was high, and a number of geographical societies and important geographic journals were established. In 1851, the American Geographical and Statistical Society was founded in New York City (“statistical” was later dropped from its title). In 1854, August Petermann founded <em>Petermanns Geographische Mitteilungen</em>, a journal of geography and cartography, in Gotha, Thuringia, in what later was to be central Germany. <em>Petermann</em> and his craftsmen were experts in lithography and especially chromo-lithography, the art of lithographing in co-registered color. Their skills quickly made Petermanns the premier geographic journal on the planet. An examination of a single annual volume for the year 1859 yields three maps that convey the frontiers of maritime navigation in that year, in multiple senses. The maps are stratified by the three bands of latitude they present: the tropics, the broad temperate zone, and the arctic. </p>
<p>The tropical map presents a historic political and legal framework unfamiliar to most Americans: The great archipelago of islands constituting American Polynesia. The context is this: by the 1840s, American supplies of phosphate rock, a relatively scarce yet critical chemical material used in gunpowder and for fertilizer, were running out. Bird guano, deposited over eons on exposed rocks and islands in the oceans, became a substitute for mined deposits of phosphate rock. Many of these rocks and islands were located in extremely remote places, which is in part why they were favorable sites for nesting birds. In 1856, Congress passed the Guano Islands Act, which stated: “Whenever any citizen of the United States discovers a deposit of guano on any island, rock, or key, not within the lawful jurisdiction of any other Government, and not occupied by the citizens of any other Government, and takes peaceable possession thereof, and occupies the same, such island, rock, or key may, at the discretion of the President, be considered as appertaining to the United States.” Only three years later, many dozens of such rocks and islands and keys in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean had been claimed as territories of the United States, and hence a broad curvy line encircles a portion of the vast archipelago of islands and reefs straddling the Equator. Note that this 1859 conception of American Polynesia did not include American Samoa, which is a portion of the Samoa cluster of islands in the center of the map directly south of the boundary of American Polynesia. American claims to Samoa came later, between 1887-1889, in a great crisis between the United States, Imperial Germany, and Great Britain. </p>
<p>In 1859, the United States and Great Britain were involved in contention and disputes over territorial claims in the great band of temperate latitudes, on the Pacific coast at the boundary zone between Washington Territory in the United States, and British Columbia in Canada, then still claimed by Great Britain as British territory. The terrestrial portion of the boundary between the nations was mutually agreed to be the 49th Parallel of latitude, but agreements dissolved at the Pacific water’s edge. Great Britain and the United States agreed that all of Vancouver Island was British, although it extended south of the 49th Parallel. But there are a myriad of islands in between Vancouver Island and the mainland of the continent: To whom would they belong? The Haro Archipelago, or San Juan Islands, was at stake. As the map in <em>Petermanns</em> clearly reveals, the rival national boundary claims are actually two major ship routes in between the Strait of Juan de Fuca on the south, and the Georgia Strait on the north. Hence, the national claims to territory on land were based on different pathways of ships in the water around the land. Eventually Great Britain acceded to the American claims, and the San Juan Islands are part of the state of Washington in the United States. </p>
<p>Moving now to the Arctic, we can examine a map and another inset map defining one of the most celebrated tragedies of exploration in the nineteenth century. For centuries, European explorers had searched for a conjectured “Northwest Passage” which would lead from the western Atlantic Ocean further northwest to enter the Pacific Ocean, allowing travel by water at temperate latitudes, with minimal disruptions and hazards from ice. None of their explorations were successful, although in the effort they “discovered” major portions of what is now Canada, almost all of which had already been explored and settled by native Athebascan, Micmac, Algonquin, Iroquois, and Inuit and other peoples. Eventually, Sir John Barrow, who was Second Secretary of the British Admiralty from 1804 until 1845, proposed that Great Britain should search for a much more northerly Northwest Passage, which would link the more northern Atlantic Ocean to the Arctic Ocean, essentially going over the top of most of Canada. Eventually Barrow settled on Sir John Franklin to command the expedition to find the passage. Under him were the officers and men of two ships, HMS Terror and HMS Erebus, which had been built for duty exploring the fringes of Antarctica, and were well equipped for Arctic service. Each had a steam engine designed and built by British railroads, along with steam-heat for the crew, and ships’ libraries with more than a thousand books. They departed England in May, 1845. Apart from Franklin and the captain of the other ship, and an assistant surgeon and two ice-masters, none of the other 129 men had any experience at all in the Arctic. Off they steamed, and disappeared. After two years had passed, the British public, and also Lady Franklin, urged the Admiralty to send teams to search for the party and learn their fate. The search for the fate of Lord Franklin became one of the cultural touchstones of the era. Many expeditions were launched, and over time, clues were found. The 1859 <em>Petermanns</em> map indicates the major findings as of that date, although the “search for Lord Franklin” continued well into the twentieth century. The map on the left shows the known route of the expedition until it turned back south. The two dotted paths were the speculative routes necessary so that ships’ survivors could have arrived on the small islands in McClintock Sound where significant remains and clues were found. The map on the right, at a much larger scale, shows the final area and its context. It also demonstrates that waves of searchers managed to ignore native Inuit place names, if they even knew them in the first place, and instead they littered the landscape with their own names. </p>`;

The differences between the two expeditions include better luck and better provisions, but also the changes underway in the very purposes and goals of exploration by ship in extreme Arctic and Antarctic environments. In 1872, the Austro-Hungarian North Pole Expedition, which was privately funded by several wealthy noble families in Austria-Hungary, steamed into the Arctic Ocean in summer aboard a small fleet of ships, the main one of which was the Tegetthoff, a three-masted schooner with a powerful steam engine. The two leaders, Captain Weyprecht and Julius von Payer, were skilled scientists, and the small crew included many specialists in meteorology, astronomy, geodesy, and terrestrial magnetism. The Tegetthoff sailed north, discovering the Franz Josef Archipelago of Arctic islands before the ship was caught in pack ice. For almost two years, the ship was stuck in the ice, although the pack ice moved, as they were able to measure by determining their positions astronomically. In May, 1874, the party determined to abandon the ice-locked ship and return south over the ice, with sledges carrying small boats to be used once they reached the margins of the ice pack. They actually accomplished this, and on August 14, 1874, they reached the open ocean. On September 3, they reached the Russian mainland, having sailed and rowed across more than a hundred miles of the open Arctic Ocean. They returned to Vienna, the capital of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, as heroes. Members of the expedition published many reports on various scientific observations from the voyage, and their productivity was a spur towards the creation of a great collaborative scientific project, the International Polar Year, in 1882-83. The voyage of the Tegetthoff was in many ways the beginnings of modern polar science.</p>`;

  return `<p>A related application of maritime navigation to the earth sciences can be seen in Otto Krümmel’s pioneering map of the Sargasso Sea, at the center of the North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre, published in Petermanns in 1891. The Sargasso Sea is named for Sargassum, a genus of brown algae, and especially Sargassum bacciferum, which grows in abundance in the lens of warm water pushed in on top of permanently colder water below by the actions of the subtropical gyre which surrounds the Sea. A look back at Bowditch and Blunt’s 1807 chart showing <a href="/navigating-the-coasts-and-seas/1807-trade-winds#top">“The Trade Wind”</a> compared to Krümmel’s map, shows the relationship between an arm of the gyre and the Sargasso Sea. The dense Sargassum drifts in the Sargasso Sea serve as nurseries for the larvae of both American and European eel species, and as protective habitat for young endangered loggerhead sea turtles, as well as many other sea creatures. On the map, the dark cross-hatched strands which are largely vertical or horizontal represent the mappings that the great German scientist Alexander von Humboldt made of what he called “Fucusbänke”, the long windrow-like concentrations of Sargassum as he found them. Krümmel, by contrast, mapped his own perceptions of the distribution of Sargassum in tints of vivid green “by the aid of steam”, as the <em>Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society</em> reported on Krümmel’s 1891 publication in <em>Petermanns</em>. By this, they refer to Krümmel’s main data source, which were the logs of many German steam ships that recorded the presence and densities of Sargassum as they steamed across the Atlantic. Krümmel synthesized this mass of data to make the first reasonably accurate map of the Sargasso Sea.</p>`;

  return `<p>The US Coast Survey began working cooperatively with the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1871, long before the “annexation” of the Kingdom into the United States. But the Survey’s mandate included mapping the territorial waters of the nation, so from about 1900 on, first the Survey, and now NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, has produced nautical charts of the Hawaiian Island, which is really a great arced archipelago of volcanic islands and fringing coral reefs. The 1934 version of the Survey’s chart displays many features of the profound changes in mapping and navigational technologies that were introduced in the early twentieth century. Following the disaster of the sinking of the Titanic in 1912, Reginald Fessenden and other scientists at the Submarine Signal Company explored using pulses of underwater sound to reflect off icebergs and return to the transmitting ship, thereby providing warnings of an iceberg ahead. They discovered, though, that the sound would also reflect off the ocean bottom and return to the transmitting ship. Given accurate knowledge of the speed of sound transmission through sea water, which is itself a complex subject, they realized it would be possible to estimate the depth of the water to the bottom below. After the Second World War and further underwater acoustics research, Herbert Dorsey invented the fathometer, the first precise depth finding device. Dorsey joined the Survey, and by the late 1920s, the Survey was using fathometers to measure deep water depths rapidly and accurately, thereby completely eliminating the need for stopping a Survey ship for lead line soundings of the bottom. The fathometers worked as the ship steamed ahead. The pronounced patterning of lines of numbers on the Hawaiian nautical chart represents the very tracks followed by the Survey ships as they steamed in uniform configurations around the main set of islands, or steamed toward and back from isolated islands, such as Palmyra Island, south of the main set of Hawaiian Islands, and visible in the <a href="/navigating-the-coasts-and-seas/1859-frontiers-of-ocean">1859 map that appeared in <em>Petermanns</em></a>. Palmyra Island is in fact one the islands originally claimed as US territory by the Guano Islands Act! There was, in fact, no guano on Palmyra island, and in 1862 it was formally annexed to the Kingdom of Hawaii under King Kamehameha IV, and later transferred to the United States as part of the annexation of Hawaii. Note as well the influence of radio on the Hawaiian chart. The chart shows two radio beacon stations, represented by red circles, one on Kauai and one on Oahu. Ships and planes with directional radio equipment could “fly the beam” broadcast by the radio beacon to determine their positions relative to the stations from far out of sight of the islands.</p>`;

  return `<p>By the mid-nineteenth century, independent nation-states emerged throughout the Americas, and sponsored mapping projects to learn about and promote their countries at home and abroad. Venezuela declared independence from Spain in 1811 and emerged as a sovereign state in 1830. Spurred on by an Italian veteran of the Napoleonic and South American independence wars, Agustín Codazzi, the President and Congress commissioned an atlas to document its new territory. Codazzi spent most of the 1830s directing Venezuela’s Chorographic Commission. They traveled the country collecting information, compiling statistics, surveying, and drawing maps. Codazzi took the materials to Paris, where he supervised production of the 1840 <em>Atlas físico y politico de Venezuela</em>, which introduced the international community to Venezuela’s people, geography and history in nineteen plates. Codazzi had initially intended to include both text and maps; in the end the <em>Atlas’s</em> text accompaniment was published separately the following year. </p>
<p>Codazzi’s atlas tells the story of the country’s physical and political features, with maps of Venezuela’s political jurisdictions at independence in 1810 and as a nation-state in 1840, of individual departments, and of the country’s hydrography and climate areas. As such, it has earned admiration as an early Spanish American national atlas. However, the atlas also places Venezuela in global and hemispheric context and covers movement in the Americas, from sixteenth-century exploration to nineteenth-century military maneuvers. </p>
<p>The theme of exploration appears in the volume’s first three maps, which place Venezuela in geographic and historical context. A planisphere map, at a scale of 1:75,000,000, shows Venezuela in a globe united by the tracks of Ferdinand Magellan and Juan Sebastián del Cano’s 1519 circumnavigation. The second map depicts the major political divisions of the Western Hemisphere [FIGURE 1] in 1840, with Venezuelan and other lands and populations at a scale of 1:31,500,000. Codazzi used the hemispheric view to introduce the history of American explorations, in a curious combination of key journeys from two periods and objectives. The first shows the sea and land routes of Spanish territorial conquest: Christopher Columbus’s “discovery” of the New World (1492), Francisco Balboa’s “discovery” of the South Sea (Pacific Ocean) (1506), and conquerors Hernán Cortes and Francisco Pizarro, who respectively defeated the Aztec (1519-20) and Inca Empires (1531-3). Alonso de Ojeda and Amerigo Vespucci, who reached Cumaná in contemporary Venezuela in 1507 and (not inconsequentially) inspired the naming of the hemisphere, round out the early circum-Caribbean trips. Interestingly, the second period of exploration belongs to English-speakers in North America: Codazzi maps the route of the 1806 Lewis and Clark expedition, which finished the “conquest” of mainland North America, and four Arctic expeditions seeking the Northwest Passage (Alexander Mackenzie, 1789; William Parry, 1821-23; John Franklin’s “companions,” 1826; John Ross’ 1833 return to Europe after planting a British flag at the magnetic pole). Why would a Venezuelan atlas include these scientific expeditions? </p>
<p>The third map, “Mapa de las Costas de la Tierra Firme desde el Orinoco hasta Yucatan,” at 1:5,300,000, zooms in on what seems a traditional ocean view of the circum-Caribbean, showing the water highway connecting islands and the mainland [FIGURE 2]. Again, Codazzi adds Spanish journeys of discovery. Here, strikingly, he also identifies and places the dozens of native peoples living in Venezuela, using color and symbols to indicate their language, their independence or submission to European rule, and their level of cultural assimilation. Was the choice to include native peoples here, and not in the national and departmental maps intended to minimize possible objections to their inclusion as a separate category of people? In theory, Venezuela’s 1830 constitution offered universal male citizenship (Constitución, 1830, articles 13-15). </p>
<p>If exploration sneaks onto general maps, the atlas dedicates six maps in four sheets to the wars of independence, tracing the movements and battles won and lost by Simón Bolívar, Antonio Páez and others from 1810 to 1826 [FIGURES 3 and 4] within the Viceroyalty of New Granada, a territory which became independent as a single country (Gran Colombia) before dividing into three separate polities, Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador, in 1830. One sword indicates a skirmish; crossed swords a battle. Tips up means a Venezuelan triumph, tips down, a loss. These maps capture not only armed forces’ movements, but also changing popular allegiances, coloring territories loyal to Spain red and those opting for independence and revolution yellow. For the hard years of 1815-1817, small yellow enclaves of “guerrilla” bands in a sea of red drive home how the revolution was pushed to operate offshore as it was, literally, almost wiped off the map. By 1818, support along the Amazon provided Bolívar and his allies bases to move inland between Angostura, Achaguas, and Valencia; after taking Trujillo, by 1820, they marched towards victory. </p>
<p>Who learned the lessons of the atlas that connected politics, history, and geography? Since in 1840 many Venezuelans lacked the means or interest in acquiring Codazzi’s atlas, distribution was likely intended to inform Venezuelan and Spanish American elites, diplomats, and potential investors. For Europeans and North Americans who might read this atlas, the cartographic “declaration of independence” established Venezuela as a well-defined political space with a well-known coast and interior, with a heroic past in exploration and a present based on feats of military prowess and ability to master challenging terrain. Those political and military statements would have resonated with the United States, which had achieved and confirmed independence in two wars with Great Britain, and which in 1823 had articulated the “Monroe Doctrine” to discourage European meddling in the Americas. What was missing, perhaps, was an accounting of mineral and other resources that might have inspired the commercial classes to make explorations for opportunity on their own; an interesting editorial decision. </p>`;

  return `<p>Hiram Bingham, a Harvard PhD and “lecturer” at Yale, is perhaps best known for an archaeological “find”: Machu Picchu. But on his first trip to South America, in 1906-1907, Bingham undertook a scientific “expedition” to repair a great lacuna in the history of the wars of independence. For, he lamented, “I could find no maps of [Simón Bolívar’s] battle fields and few trustworthy accounts of the scenes of his greatest activity” (v). </p>
<p>Bingham kitted up to determine if, as Spanish American historians supposedly asserted, the trek along an “impassable” road across Venezuela and Colombia was “as wonderful as the more famous marches of Hannibal and Napoleon [over the Alps].” His company included Royal Geographic Society-trained Dr. Alexander Hamilton Rice (who stayed to explore the Amazon), two West Indian guides, and first a Venezuelan cart driver and then a Colombian not-so-ex-thief. Bingham spent a month in Caracas, ten days on the Carabobo battlefield, and four months crossing the Llanos and Andes to Bogotá, following routes from two of Bolívar’s campaigns (1819-20, Achaguas-Bogotá and 1821, Barinas-Carabobo-Valencia-Caracas) and making “scientific observations” he hoped would serve history, geography, and ethnology (v-vi). </p>
<p>Bingham did explore and sketch the battlefields (on which he also hunted, with a visiting aristocratic Venezuelan and his blood hounds), and sorted out to his own satisfaction the movements of Spanish troops, Bolivar’s forces and the British Legion that helped win the battle of Carabobo for the Liberator (35-38). On the road, he gained appreciation of the hardships the troops encountered by experiencing almost impassible swamps, poorly provisioned plains, and a steep, treacherous mountain pass in the inhospitable cordillera. However, despite writing that “it is to be our task to make a map,” Bingham published no maps of his findings, instead offering an appendix describing the battle. Bingham had the tools: He itemized an extensive kit including surveying instruments, a theodolite, prismatic compasses, and a sextant. </p>
<p>Bingham’s book sports only a “sketch map”, at 1:3,000,000 scale, prepared for a twenty-six-page article about the journey published by the Royal Geographic Society in 1908. The map is a fairly straightforward route map on a topographical background, showing a trek of about 1000 miles from Valencia, Venezuela, to Bogotá, Colombia, from “barren plains [to] unfrequented mountain passes” (25) on foot, mule, and dugout canoe. Carabobo, the war-changing battle, is marked with two swords; no other battle site is so singled out. If Bingham or Rice contributed directly to this map, neither is credited. Still, this map likely incorporates height measurements taken by Rice, who trained at the RGS and whom Bingham noted in an offhand way took nightly readings with the theodolite (64). It also showed the route from the places identified in Bingham’s text. </p>
<p>Yet even this route is a little misleading. Given the purpose of the expedition, readers might be forgiven for thinking Bolívar, too, went from Valencia to Bogotá, but Bingham reveals at the beginning of his narrative that the first part of his route is only approximate as unseasonably late rains had put much of the central Llanos, where Bolivar assembled his troops, under water. The party thus took an alternate route to Carabobo and skirted the plains intending to join Bolivar’s route near Achaguas and the Apure river (2). As such, the map is actually more faithful to Bingham’s than to Bolivar’s movement, making comparison with Codazzi worth the effort. </p>
<p>What role did maps play on the journey? The author mentions several times that he has maps with him, and regrets that the head of Caracas’s Cajigal observatory would not let him take notes from or copy Venezuela’s new military map. Yet despite commenting that this information might have made the journey “somewhat easier” (19, 25), Bingham never mentions using maps on the plains or in the mountains. He does identify the travel accounts he scoured for a hint of what the itinerary would be like (233-4). Rather, along the route, Bingham and Rice first followed telegraph poles and later hired local guides to select their paths, which were often longer and more difficult than the well-trafficked routes still used by Venezuelan and Colombian <em>arrieros</em>, cattle drivers, and others. </p>`;

  return `<p>By the early twentieth century, tens of thousands of North Americans were joining their forebears in setting sail for the Spanish Main—the islands of the Caribbean and countries of Central America. Some followed in the footsteps of businessmen like Joseph Dimock, and came to invest in agriculture, whether sugar in Cuba or coffee in Central America and Colombia; others followed writers like Richard Henry Dana (on an 1859 “Vacation voyage”) or Julia Ward Howe, who the next year mocked the “undistinguishable individuals who we class together as Yankees…the Southerner being as like the Northerner as a dried pea is to a green pea” on a “trip to Cuba.” Increasing numbers were on a family vacation, with nothing more in mind than a holiday of one to three weeks with the chance to see new sites, taste tropical fruits, and escape winter. </p>
<p>Still, as in the nineteenth century, fleets served multiple purposes. Grace Line was first and foremost a freight line, bringing nitrates, sugar, coffee, and other products from company properties in Peru, Bolivia, and trading partners in Central and South America. It also earned substantial revenue after taking over PacMail’s contract to deliver US mail from the East to West coasts via the Panama Canal. And it also carried passengers, at first largely businessmen but increasingly the leisure traveler. W.R. Grace was at intersection of commerce, communication, and tourism, a trifecta that shimmered in the romantic map-poster designed to entertain and entice passengers aboard. Who better to design such a map than an artist tied to both continents? </p>
<p>Born in Uruguay to a Catalonian father and French mother, Joseph Jacinto (“Jo”) Mora (1876-1947) grew up in the US and lived most of his adult life in California and the Southwest, painting, drawing, sculpting, illustrating and writing, and the Spanish influence on the Americas and Western life were frequent themes. His “cartes” (charts) of California, Yosemite, and Carmel were illustrated maps and posters designed by and for himself. In 1933 Mora traveled on the invitation of Grace Lines and produced two works as a result. The first was a humorous but informative logbook, with vignettes and maps of ports of call and brief biographies and portraits of the principal pirates of the Caribbean. </p>
<p>The second was a pictorial map of “Ye Olde Spanish Maine” integrating illustrative details of traditional cartography—ships and activities in the ocean, coasts from San Francisco to New York, via Panama—with contemporary and historical information. Drawing on cartographic traditions of a decorative nature, the map had a border of vignettes and several insets. The border (Left) shows scenes of history, from portraits of conquistadors and their principal successes, to a nod to Maya antiquities and Sir Francis Drake’s plundering, to Simon Bolívar’s independence movement. Along the right-hand side, the vignettes favor more tales of piracy and celebrate pears, Central American “king” coffee and Colombian emeralds. Across the top, a rough rider straddles the canal, while ‘types’ on horseback, muleback, and oxcart from Canada to Colombia approach the center waving national flags. Below the map, “ye past” of disorderly pirates, Spanish priests, and conquistadors contrasts with “ye present” of progress and the handshake of good neighbors. The Grace Line captain extends his hand to the demure Spanish señorita and her farmer beau, with a motley line of passengers sweating behind him. It is not just Uncle Sam and his military arm who link the hemisphere, as seen above, but the W.R. Grace Company, which (not coincidentally) has its own standard. </p>
<p>Like the 1726 Carte Marine of Tierra Firme (FIGURE 1), and Codazzi’s 1840 Atlas (FIGURE 2), this “Spanish Maine” is in its “informative intent” “historical and topographical” yet, as Mora writes, “it is rendered in the manner humorous that its perusal may be accomplished rather with the smile of levity than the frown of research.” </p>
<p>Despite the humor of the drawings, the map is generally accurate and the vignettes informative, both about the places visited and about Grace’s commercial interests. For example, the Guatemala inset, topped by the national bird, the quetzal, shows the route from cruise liner to shore at San José, and then the rail route to Guatemala, Mexico, or the USA, through banana and sugar lowlands, up into the foothills where coffee is grown, around the three volcanos on view from colonial center Antigua, and across Lake Amatitlán into Guatemala City, the destination and national capital. Transportation, agricultural export commodities, and tourist destinations were all elements of the Grace portfolio. The Panama Canal vignette offers the canal route side-by-side with the mid-nineteenth century railroad line, and offers statistical information of length, yearly capacity, US occupation, first use, and the fact that 7873 miles are shaved on trips to New York and San Francisco that can avoid the Magellan straits. The canal’s facilitation of trade between East and West Coast was central to Grace’s business model. </p>`;

  return `<p>By the 1930s, American motorists were increasingly willing to drive south of the border. According to the Chicago Daily Tribune in 1934, Mexico had joined Canada and France at the “top of the list” of American tourist destinations. Mexico encouraged the visitors, completing a motor highway down the eastern side of the country, from Laredo, Texas to Mexico City, part of the Pan-American Highway at a cost of sixty-two million pesos between 1925 and 1937 (40). It also built roads to other points of “high historic and scenic interest heretofore difficult to reach.” (<em>New York Times</em>, July 1, 1935) Mexico’s secretariat of the interior attributed a rise from only thirteen hundred tourists in 1932 to fifty thousand in 1936 to improved means of transportation, a favorable exchange rate, the rise of popular literature on Mexican history and culture. By 1941, Mexico had 35,000 miles of transitable highway (4500 paved) and automobile tourists could expect to get to the Pacific Coast, a journey of 1044 miles, in “perfect driving comfort.” (Martin 1941)</p>
<p>While US motorists could pick up route and road maps at home from the American Automobile Association (AAA) or the oil companies, no such wide distribution network existed in Mexico. Expatriate folklorist Frances Toor, who moved to Mexico after graduating from University of California, Berkeley in 1922, thus adapted her popular 1936 guidebook into a motorist’s guide in 1938. For, she argued, “visitors who come to Mexico by automobile will necessarily make entirely different arrangements for touring the country than those who come …by rail, plane, or steamship.” A significant change to her volume was in its cartography. The 1936 guidebook included a single-fold-out strip map of the Laredo-Mexico City route, about twenty inches long and awkward to unfold. By 1938, the maps were the thing. Opening the volume, the motorist immediately found endpaper maps showing all of Mexico and its highways, with “data…furnished by courtesy of the tourist Department of Sinclair Refining Co.” For an English-speaking audience, knowing that this map was produced by a North American gasoline company would have been reassuring. The map told the ease or difficulty of the routes at a glance, identifying paved, graveled, and dirt roads, and roads under construction, in Mexico’s national colors of red, white and green. The three national highways (CN-Carretera Nacional) have been completed. As maps showing the US/Mexico border frequently do, this map shows the twin cities on either side (Ciudad Juarez, Mexico/El Paso, Texas) to help readers get their bearings.</p>
<p>The guidebook’s more significant contribution to motorists was the 23 itinerary or strip maps “drawn especially for this book, and carefully checked for accuracy,” inserted after more than three hundred pages of practical advice and description. Most are a single page in size “to avoid the nuisance of unfolding.” Three US cities offer itinerary starting points: San Antonio, Brownsville-Matamoros and Nogales, Texas; each leads the driver in two to three stages (maps) to Mexico City. In addition, five multi-part itineraries start in Mexico City and lead to key tourist stops, including Cuernavaca, Taxco, and “arts and crafts villages near Toluca.” So Toor’s routes served not only those driving to Mexico from the US, but any English-speaking people in Mexico with vehicles. These strip maps identify refueling locations as “gas - water,” suggesting that both car and driver might simultaneously find refreshment. On the left, each strip map records the distance between towns in miles and kilometers, and on the right marks elevations in feet and meters to signal to the detail-oriented that the black line making its way across an “empty” land might be deceptive. Later editions replace these separate figures by drawing distances between stopping points next to the highway and elevations crosshatched to show exactly where the road rose or fell.</p>
<p>The guide also includes a map of highways in Yucatán and two of the Valley of Mexico, an area first represented in a 1524 map published to accompany Hernán Cortes’ conquest account. The Valley of Mexico maps update the earlier maps’ emphasis on causeways leading to the lake-bound city center, instead highlighting roads and routes for entering and leaving the now-landlocked city by car via the highways extending out around the valley. In the first map, principal transversal streets—Paseo de la Reforma, Avenida Insurgentes, Calzada de Tlalpan—point readers to outskirt towns and tourist sites, from the shrine to the Virgin of Guadalupe in the north to the floating gardens of Xochimilco in the south. In the latter, a cathedral stands in for the city center, a red outline marks the urban zone, and mileage tells motorists the distances out of the valley and past the Texcoco lake bed, volcanoes of Popocatepétl and Ixtaccihuátl, mountains ringing the city, and the pyramids of Teotihuacan—the first natural features to be named on the maps.</p>
<p>Although this guidebook would seem to be by and for United States tourists, Toor wrote the text with the help of a distinguished group of North American collaborators from both sides of the border: the engineer who headed Mexico’s automobile association, a Northwestern University astronomy professor, and William Harwood Swales, likely a fellow expatriate, who had driven most of the roads. Perhaps more importantly, the maps were locally made. As a folklorist who had worked with leading members of Mexico’s muralist movement (including Diego Rivera), Toor drew on local talent for illustrations and maps, although she used Sinclair Company data. Guatemalan-born artist Carlos Medina and an “A. Cervantes” (possibly engineer Enrique A. Cervantes Sánchez) contributed the cover art, an impressionistic view of a car winding through the mountains, and the internal road and strip maps, although they did not sign them.</p>
<p>Toor had made a good business decision to develop maps for North American motorists. Their numbers kept climbing, from 188,000 visitors in 1940, who spent $54 million, to an expectation of over 200,000 in 1941, anticipated to spend $70 million. By 1948, tourism was Mexico’s 4th largest industry, with income rising from 15 million in 1936 to 78 million in 1945 and 118 million in 1947. 91% of those tourist dollars and tourists were from the USA, with 53% from Texas and 17% from California—so roads were not, in the end, a bad investment (Carney). Toor later incorporated strip maps into a “new guide” for all inbound “by plane, car, train, bus and boat” transportation which had appeared in multiple Mexican English-language editions in the 1940s and US editions beginning in 1950.</p>`;

  return `<p>In 1808, Portuguese authorities opened Brazilian ports to international trade at the behest of Great Britain, which had transported the entire court from Lisbon to (Bahia) after Napoleon invaded Portugal. A hundred years later, Rio de Janeiro hosted a national exposition to celebrate a century of international commerce, an event sponsored by Miguel Calmon du Pin e Almeida, Minister of Industry, Roads, and Public Works. To inform and disseminate Brazil’s modernity, the ministry commissioned an elaborate and elegant volume of statistics to punctuate the event, with small maps of physical, geological, geographic, and demographic Brazil, and tables of statistics on everything from immigrant national origins to trade products. In addition, the ministry sponsored this detail-packed small-scale map of Brazil, almost a meter long and a meter high, that, had it been hung on a wall, would trumpet the range of Brazil’s economic and commercial prowess and progress at a glance. </p>
<p>The map was printed in Sao Paulo by the Hartmann-Reichenbach lithographic company, presumably from figures and cartography produced by the ministry, although no author is named. The Exposition kept the firm’s presses rolling; in addition to the maps, it printed postcards, award certificates, and additional maps for the ministry, including the 1909 <em>Carta da viação ferrea dos E.U. do Brasil</em> (Map of the Railways of the US of Brazil) by the Office of Railways’ chief civilian and military engineers, which won an exposition grand prize (Though there were many such grand prizes handed out). </p>
<p>The 1908 map was typical of early twentieth-century Latin American commercial maps that used an increasingly accurate geographical base map to emphasize an array of movements: of people, information and trade goods via transport on land and water. As might be expected, the ministry also snuck in a lot of raw tabular data (labeled a “statistical map”) as well, providing a century’s worth of information on each state’s population, imports and exports, surface area, railroad mileage, and so forth. The column detailing “natural resources (wealth), products, industry and commerce” lists so many goods in such small print it would be a wonder if anyone read it. The Brazilians couldn’t help doing a little bit of size boasting as well, comparing its area and population to that of other countries and empires. It found itself larger than all but three empires—Great Britain, Russia, and China—and larger than both France and the United States, if those countries’ overseas territories were not included. </p>
<p>On land, the main political and geographical map of Brazil (which largely fills the sheet) lays down railroad and telegraph routes, as well as roads both finished and under construction. By water, there are river, coastal and international steamship routes, each with a distinct symbol and a paragraph listing the companies providing service along the routes. At the end of the map, where routes go off the page, company names and their home ports are named, but to clarify the multi-continental partnerships, an inset map shows the routes reaching their final destinations in Africa, the United States, and Western Europe. </p>
<p>It is a serious map meaning serious business—for investors, merchants and other international wheelers and dealers. But buried in the details of the legend is the link to a surprising toponym hidden in the geography of Brazil itself. The last river navigation company listed in the legend, Mihanovich, is tied to a mystery about the naming of one of Brazil’s best-known natural features. Since the nineteenth century, tourists sought out what we now know as the Iguazu Falls—a waterfall taller than Niagara Falls in New York, if less extensive than Africa’s Victoria Falls. In 1901, Miss Victoria Aguirre, an Argentine passenger on a Mihanovich steamer, was one such admiring visitor. Apparently, so the story goes, when she learned of the difficulties an entrepreneur was having in finishing a road that would provide an admirable viewing station for the falls, she gave $3000 to the cause. At around that time, several maps (including this one) identified the falls as “Salto Victoria,” contributing to a popular story that at least some people wished to thank her by baptizing the falls—whose name means “Great Water” in Guarani—in her name. But, as a sleuthing blogger has found, at least one Edinburgh firm dating back to 1873 put a “Salto Victoria” on the map, almost thirty years before the young tourist made her generous gesture. Further sleuthing in the nineteenth-century maps digitized by the Library of Congress reveals that Brazilian and foreign nineteenth-century maps have a range of names for the falls, don’t mention them at all, and even put the falls on the wrong river. So what folks knew, and when they knew it, and whether the inspiration for the “Victoria Falls” on this 1908 map was a Queen or a sightseer (or a problematic decision to copy the 1873 map!), most maps referred to the cascade as Iguazu. Would it not have been odd to have two Victoria Falls, on two continents? Today, the city of Iguazu has a Victoria Aguirre street, a fitting tribute to generosity that keeps her on at least some maps and is a testimony to the mobility of early twentieth-century South Americans (Bernárdez 1901, 64). </p>`;

  return `<p>Less than a hundred years after the US post office contracted steamships to get mail from east to west coasts, the same bureaucracy contracted fledgling airlines to fly the mail north and south to and from Buenos Aires and points in between. From October 18 to October 28, 1929, Chicago newspaperman Junius B. Wood (University of Michigan ’03) was an invited passenger on the second run of a new eight-thousand-mile airmail route from Buenos Aires to Miami, reporting on his trip in <em>Homewards Flies the Mail</em>, a collection of articles in which he made the news and was the news, and which were originally printed in October in the <em>Chicago Daily Tribune</em>.  </p>
<p>Wood’s text and the volume’s maps together make the case that this new, fastest, longest mail route is “extend[ing] friendly hands across the hemispheres.” (11) Wood’s account opened with a chart of the Panagra airlines route represented as a race starting in Montevideo and reaching Chicago. Panagra, which merged with Braniff International Airways in 1967, had been a joint venture of Pan American Airways and the W.R. Grace Shipping Company, whose 1933 cruise poster, <em>Ye Olde Spanish Main</em>, is discussed later. Wood’s chart echoed the style of the 1855 Panama Railway map, a practice common in air cartography’s early days, resembling the airlines’ own timetable maps. The map presented a route as a solid line with stops indicated on top of a map blank but for the dotted lines showing country borders, names of nations, stops, seas and oceans. A dotted line from Atlanta to Chicago breaks the pattern; bad weather forced Wood to complete this part of his journey by train.  </p>

The highest altitude reached (20,700 feet, over the Andes), lowest altitude (fifteen feet, between clouds and Pacific), planes used (ten), pilots and mechanics (fifteen), where Wood started (Montevideo, 4pm, October 18), where the mail came aboard (Buenos Aires, October 19, 8 am), the number of miles flown from Montevideo to Atlanta (8054), elapsed time (ten days, two hours, twenty minutes) and flying time (three days,  nineteen minutes). The charts and tables here show how, once again, transportation moved people in the Americas faster and faster; a ten-day flight to Miami from Buenos Aires might seem cumbersome today, but took half the time of a steamer trip. Wood repeatedly emphasized the company’s precision—leaving at 8 o’clock exactly—and ethic of “neither rain, nor hail, nor snow…” Although the lonely passenger, who noted that he shared a spacious room designed for fourteen with the mail, was neither cartographer nor pilot, he did provide insight into the manner by which the pilot managed to follow his route. En route to Mendoza from Buenos Aires, he commented on how the pilot, who flew by compass to start, used railway station signs which “showed where we were” and then followed the railroad tracks, not only for locational purposes but because ”there was less chance of an Argentine windmill bobbing up as an unpleasant surprise.” Speed and comfort again were trip leitmotifs—as they landed in Mendoza, in the Andes of northern Argentina at 1:45pm, Woods noted that this “fastest trip from Buenos Aires” of 690 miles under five hours beat a “road which 100 years ago horsemen in relays, leaving their spent… and dying mounts along the trail, occasionally did in seven days.” (10)  </p>
<p>But because this is a travel account drafted by a reporter, not a pilot or company executive, the little volume includes a second lively map to embellish the story. The second map is illustrated, or perhaps better said, is an illustration, signed by “Chisholm”; this was perhaps Christine L. Chisholm, a Chicago-based children’s book illustrator. This more fanciful route wends its way up a hemispheric map stripped down to its coastlines, with no country names or borders in sight. Neptune initiates passengers at the equator—a sea ceremony not celebrated in airships—while sea monsters, icebergs, flying fish, and a submarine populate relevant ocean segments. An airplane enters the picture from the southeast, and (like Martin Waldseemüller’s sparsely illustrated Americas map of 1507), offers choice vignettes: An arriero and his mules trekking across south America, a siesta-taking Mexican (complete with sombrero) under a palm, and a cowboy on a bucking bronco wooing a bashful señorita­. Outside the hemispheric circle, envelopes flutter and a single wind blows from the southeast, a galley ship with oars a-rowing floats curiously at the northwest, and a compass rose and cartouche title, with a cornucopia of plenty filling north east and southwest corners respectively.  </p>
<p>Like Robert Tomes, who reported that the Panama Railway created a highway across Central America, Wood celebrated the new air route that would foster communication and commerce between north and south and “helping [to] extend friendly hands across the hemispheres” (11). Unlike Tomes, Wood was not entirely comfortable; while he wasn’t a complainer, he did note (repeatedly) moments of discomfort from needing earplugs to block the motor’s noise, hitting his head on the ceiling during an abrupt drop in altitude (no seatbelts, yet), lack of sleep, and eating food on the fly, literally, as they often picked up sandwiches and drinks during stops of less than half an hour, all in the name of speed and progress. And, also unlike Tomes, his was not a journey that thousands would immediately repeat. On October 29, the day after Tomes landed in Miami, Florida, the prosperity that supported the development of air travel was rocked. The US stock market crashed, ushering in the Great Depression; its consequences included slower growth in air travel.  </p>
<p>Still, Wood’s mail tale really had legs (or wings). Not only did the <em>Chicago Daily Tribune</em> package it as a separate publication, but the <em>National Geographic Magazine</em> ran a separate story under Wood’s byline. That august periodical commissioned its own land-based photographs to complement Wood’s snapshots from the air and, of course, a new (and graticuled) route map drawn by James M. Darley. This map, superficially similar to the first map discussed, was in fact more informative. It distinguished between overnight stops and other landings, named peaks from Aconcagua to Chimborazo, and (not surprisingly) only showed the mail run from Montevideo to Miami, leaving the story of Wood’s arrival in Chicago before the air mail itself as a newspaper exclusive (Wood 1930, 264).  </p>`;

  return `<p>When John Sutter found gold in California in 1848, he set off a cross-continental scramble among North Americans eager to try their luck at making a fortune. It was no easy trip. The US had just ended the war that secured the lands north of the Rio Grande from Mexico. The Overland Mail and regular stagecoaches were not to start until 1857, and the transcontinental railroad remained twenty years from completion. Native Americans beholden to neither the US nor Mexico defended the plains; blizzards complicated winter travel through Rocky Mountain passes. In short, despite good maps pointing the way along the Santa Fe trail and other routes, transcontinental travel across the United States was a long, arduous and sometimes fatal enterprise. Fortunately, there was another route. </p>
<p>Since the sixteenth century, mule trains laden with Peruvian gold had followed the fifty-mile <em>Camino Real</em> (Royal Road) from Panama’s Pacific to Atlantic coasts before sailing for Spain. By the mid-nineteenth century, intrepid emigrants and prospectors were taking steamships from New York City and San Francisco to follow the same trail across the isthmus. On January 25, 1855, the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, contracted to transport US mail between Panama City and San Francisco, inaugurated the “inter-oceanic” Panama Railroad, shortening the land transit from several days to four-and-a-half hours. While the company made money moving freight (including gold) across the isthmus, its raison d’être was the (half-dozen) steamers each landing 300-400 adventurers every few weeks. American physician and travel writer Robert Tomes, invited to join stockholders trying out the new railway, found that train travel transformed an uncomfortable, unhealthy and expensive mule ride and dugout boat trip over fifty swampy and forested miles. As he regaled readers in <em>Panama in 1855</em>, the train “glided mile after mile, and…so smoothly…through deep marsh…as firm now as a stone pavement” while passengers “lounged at our ease…and smoked, and talked, and looked with admiring wonder upon the tropical profusion of beauty” (75). </p>
<p>Yet looking at the map of the railroad route that introduces the chapter describing Tomes’ “ride on the rail road,” no one would ever understand why Pacific Steamship owner William Aspinwall’s initial budget of $1 million shot up to an $8 million investment, why it took two years to build the first seven miles of railroad and five to complete the entire fifty-mile route, nor why somewhere between 5,000-10,000 West Indians, Chinese, and Europeans lost their lives in the process as they worked from an area Tomes described as a “plague spot…[where] disease and premature death were endemic…in that region of swamp and vegetable rottenness” (67). This route, which is more sketch than map, despite compass rose and scale, offers a better advertisement for the trip than the text. The railway’s endpoints, Aspinwall (Colón) and Panama City are clearly marked, as are the train’s inland stations, and the Chagres River and mule paths used by previous travelers. However, that Aspinwall was a “plague-spot” cannot be determined in a map that empties the land of vegetation and elevations. The map reader, like the train passenger, glides through Panama, unfazed by and perhaps ultimately unaware of forest or swamp, or the sixty-one foot/mile rise from Aspinwall to the top of the Culebra Cut, and seventy-one foot/mile descent down into Panama City. </p>
<p>This Panama Railway route map, presumably supplied to Tomes by the company promoters responsible for inviting him on the trip, and appearing again in F.N. Otis’s 1867 guide to the railroad, <em>Isthmus of Panama</em> (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210119183710/http://archive.org/stream/isthmusofpanamah00otisrich#page/n8/mode/1up" rel="nofollow">http://archive.org/stream/isthmusofpanamah00otisrich#page/n8/mode/1up</a>) is not the only kind of transportation map to blank out inconvenient topography. Nor would “California passengers” or Tomes’ readers necessarily have felt misled by a map whose simplified spaces did not quite reflect the complicated context conveyed in the text. Certainly, as Glenda Riley has shown, the more comfortable trip probably contributed to a rise in the number of women and children on the Panama route (Riley 1986, 533). </p>
<p>The map is also silent about routes into and out of Panama, possibly because the New York and San Francisco steamship routes were well known to US readers. However, within a decade, the railway grew into a regional and international hub, as a second Otis map advertised (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210119183710/http://archive.org/stream/isthmusofpanamah00otisrich#page/n9/mode/1up" rel="nofollow">http://archive.org/stream/isthmusofpanamah00otisrich#page/n9/mode/1up</a>). By 1867 the company had opened up trade with Central America’s underserved Pacific ports, and formed a steamship company to collect and deliver goods, mail, and passengers within Central America and to China, Japan, and Australia from Panama City and to England from Aspinwall (Otis 1967). So even after the US transcontinental railroad opened in 1869, the Panama Railway Company remained profitable until sold in 1879 to the French company planning to build a Panama Canal, a job eventually completed by the United States in 1914, with the railroad transporting supplies along the route. </p>`;

  return `<p>By the mid-twentieth century, the hemisphere was increasingly and literally connected. The Pan American Highway, whose roads link North and South America for cars, the way the <em>camino real</em> (royal highway) connected colonial Spanish America for mules, was almost built. A single map (and route) could reach both Spanish- and English-speaking audiences. Commercial, touristic, and military movement on land, sea, and air appeared in the same hemispheric space. Text and image, map and picture, worked seamlessly together. What route could accomplish so much?</p>
<p>The answer is the Pan American Highway, a dream of the Conference of American Republics (predecessor to the Organization of American States) dating to 1923 and a reality in much of the hemisphere by the early 1940s, with significant US financial help. Roosevelt supported the route in part to boost trade and tourism, but also, as Edwin James, Chief of the Inter-American Regional Office, US Public Roads Administration, claimed in 1943, for military and strategic reasons. For, as he wrote in <em>Popular Mechanics</em>, “In a world conflict that is basically a War of Transportation, with a vast movement of men and military machines on a global battlefront, the Pan American Highway System is destined to play a vital role. Its building, like that of the Panama Canal, is a milepost in man’s constructive achievements and a monument to the cooperative spirit of the 21 Western Hemisphere republics that jointly built the great system of 15,000 miles of highway and principal connections… Our ‘Burma Road’ linking the Americas is close to realization… The lifeline of the Americas will prove of inestimable value in maintaining a continuous flow of materials to US war industries and a return flow of essential goods to the other Americas…perpetual nourishment for our ‘Good Neighbor’ policy” (James 1943, 29, 176).</p>
<p>Parallels to the Burma Road were not, however, likely to get more popular diplomacy underway, on either side of the Rio Grande. The strip maps that worked for a single-country trip would be unwieldy. So a more friendly face of the “Good Neighbor” policy, as presented in the General Drafting Company map, <em>The Americas</em>, or <em>Las Américas,</em> introduced the Pan-American Highway twith the exhortation to English-speaking readers to “know your neighbors better” and in Spanish, with the more inclusive encouragement to “Conozcámonos major, como buenos vecinos!”—let’s get to know each other better, like good neighbors—a two-way street that invited Latin Americans to see the Eisenhower Interstate Highway System in the US as part of a new hemispheric network.</p>
<p>Ironically, the route itself—represented by a red line, solid for completed and dotted for unfinished roads—did not exactly draw the eye. While General Drafting produced purely functional highway maps of Spanish America by the 1950s, this early venture into a Latin American roadmap was pictorial. Cartographically identical Spanish-, Portuguese-, and English-language maps enticed them to get to know each other with dozens of snapshot views of leisure destinations, economic opportunity, natural beauty, and a little history. Vignettes of bikini-clad beachgoers, ancient ruins, folkloric peoples, wildlife, cattle, coffee, cotton, petroleum, industry, and some famous nineteenth-century heroes, including Benito Juarez of Mexico, Simón Bolívar of Venezuela, and Francisco Santander of Colombia, suggested common endeavors among “all members of the family of the Americas.” If hints of the land and air transportation that already connected the hemispheres also appeared in the form of small steamers, freighters, and airships, the thick red line (dotted where construction remained) encouraged a new generation to explore the hemisphere on the new land route.</p>
<p>If General Drafting expected the same (appropriately translated) map (on the front) and individual country descriptions (on the back) to appeal to both publics equally, the company put slightly different emphasis on the text included in two inset boxes on the map. A box titled “<em>La Carretera Panamericana</em>” (“The Pan American Highway”) in both editions offers a brief history of the highway and its construction, lauding the civil engineers who pulled it off. The Spanish language edition adds a few paragraphs that promote Esso for producing the pictorial map, and anticipating new road maps it could offer the Americas’ motorists as the road finished—“modern, exact and informative maps of each country of both continents.” Emphasizing the turn of world aspirations towards ideals of peace, prosperity, progress, travels, and recreation, the mapmakers expressed pride in the highway as a “work without equal in the history of roads, a great communication way, and a monument of solidarity and friendship in the Americas.”</p>
<p>The second box was entirely different. The English language edition (distributed by General Drafting’s Education department) pointed out that the twenty-one American republics, although unknown to Europe merely five hundred years ago, offered the rest of the world high forms of ancient culture, as well as contributions in science, industry, and agriculture, but “have scarcely begun to explore and utilize all of their vast resources.” This lesson in a common hemispheric history, grouping North American with South American development, might have been a wasted lesson in the south. As such, the Spanish-language edition was again more practical, directing users to Standard Oil Company affiliates from Toronto to Havana to Montevideo to purchase more maps.</p>
<p>Perhaps the difference in message stemmed from the fact that Spanish-speaking motorists and English-speaking students were distinct audiences. It is also possible that the maps had different publication dates. Neither has a copyright or production date, so the difference could suggest distinct moments—perhaps a pre-Second World War publication date in North America (English), as the road was being finished and many newspaper stories brought it to the public’s attention, and a Second World War-era date for the Spanish edition, a moment when private companies joined the US Government to promote “friendship.” Even Disney’s Donald Duck took a star turn as a good neighbor in a film, <em>The Three Caballeros</em> (1944) and a book, <em>Donald Sees South America</em> (1945). Perhaps this map was Esso’s contribution to promoting hemispheric exchange, understanding, and friendship.</p>
<p>An earlier generation had dreamed of a Pan-American railway system; Pan-American airlines would later link the Americas by air. And in the early 1940s, individual, motorized transportation succeeded. A new generation of explorers could, and would, take to the road.</p>`;

  return `<p>Until the mid-nineteenth century, the bulk of inter-American travel took place by water. Sea and river travel, despite discomforts, dangers, and boredom, was faster, easier, and better at transporting goods and livestock than overland routes. These two manuscript sea charts are based on French naval maps and form part of a 117-sheet volume of French colonial territories owned by a Swiss gentleman. They range from “Kebec” and the Saint Lawrence Seaway to New Orleans in North America, across to Saint Domingue in the Caribbean, down the Amazon in South America, to Africa, Asia, and back to Europe. The selections offer two common nautical chart perspectives on the Caribbean. Although these hand-painted and well-preserved documents likely never went to sea and were probably only viewed by a handful of people, more workmanlike print and manuscript navigation charts would have contained similar information.</p>
<p>The first, “Carte reduite des côtes du Golfe du Mexique et des Isles de l’Amerique marquee la route des gallions,” shows the circum-Caribbean, or West Indies (land and islands surrounding the Caribbean Sea), which was one of three conventional small-scale map views of the Americas; the other two are of North America (America Septentrional), South America (Meridional). (See Moll 1736; Bowen 1747) Cartographer Philippe Buache helpfully indicates in the title cartouche that his document is based on astronomical observations made on Saint Domingue and combined with the most exact and specific observations brought back in reports to France’s Dépôt de la Marine—a reminder that this information served military as well as other purposes.</p>
<p>This chart is a sailor’s and planner’s document. For pilots, the map has compass roses with rhumb lines for plotting sea courses, key coastal features (rivers, capes, gulfs, and rocks) that make certain passages perilous, such as those around the cape of Gracias a Dios in Honduras and the Gulf of Venezuela. The blowing wind that illustrates the cartouche offers a pictorial counterpoint to the lines that dominate the map. No interior human or natural landmarks—cities, missions, rivers, or mountains—take away attention from the coasts. For the strategist, the coastlines are outlined in the colors of the imperial powers—French, Spanish, English, and Dutch—or in no color at all if the author deems the land possessed by no nation. Did native peoples’ (or Spanish?) possession of Florida not count as sovereignty to the French mapmaker? And the dotted lines of the galleon routes (which Buache never identifies as Spanish, although (perhaps not incidentally) the ship tracks are red, the same color used to identify Spanish possessions. Why would the only routes on this map indicate the tracks of the Spanish fleet?</p>
<p>The second chart, “Carte de la Coste de la Louisiane depuis la Baye de St. Bernard jusqu à celle de Saint Josephe…,” offers more specific information concerning French New World claims. For the sea journey, this chart shows the approaches via rhumb lines and also soundings along the coast for anyone thinking of bringing a ship to shore, with comments about which bays offer easy landing. However, here the land is not empty, but dotted with trees to indicate forests and with inland water routes clearly marked and annotated. Information about the peoples found on land is also included, although perhaps not reliably. At the Bay of Saint Bernard, the cartographer notes a “handsome country of high prairies” (and <em>chaumeres</em>?) where there are “nomadic savages and anthropophages.” Man-eating Native Americans on the Gulf Coast? Perhaps the mapmaker wanted to discourage anyone from landing at this particular point. The Mississippi River delta, with New Orleans situated on the edge of Lake Pontchartrain, and fronted by “flooded lands filled with lakes” that were either “impassable” or “barely passable” shows careful attention to the environment and its impact on human activity. Although no mapmaker claims authorship of this chart and the sources of the information are not detailed, we do get at least a small sense that there is more than one imperial power coasting along these shores, as the map notes that one promontory might be one the Spaniards call “Spirito Sancto.”</p>
<p>Both charts highlight the expectation that movement, conflict, and commerce between and among American territories and peoples were expected. If the Caribbean basin had the largest concentration of different nations—not to mention the stateless pirates who operated between empires—ships regularly took people, goods, and ideas across real and imagined boundary lines throughout the Americas. Although inter-American travel would get easier and faster as steam and rail emerged in the nineteenth century, hemispheric mobility was not a new phenomenon.</p>`;

  return `<p>Spanish Americans were not the only ones mapping military movement in the mid-nineteenth century Americas. US westward exploration began with the Lewis and Clark Expedition sponsored by president Thomas Jefferson, and continued with extensive military mapping during the US-Mexican War of 1846-1848. Not all of these military maps became public documents, but the Senate printed the <em>Notes of Military Reconnaissance, from Fort Leavenworth, in Missouri, to San Diego, in California, including parts of the Arkansas, Del Norte, and Gila Rivers</em> by Major W.H. Emory, the “corps topographical engineer” with the advanced guard of the “Army of the West,” in 1848. </p>
<p>US Senate and House reports may not immediately spring to mind as resources for the history of cartography, but in the nineteenth century, they often included the maps created to convince the government to invest in a road or canal, or to inform of territories needing administration. In this case, the maps show how the specific movements of American military forces help convert the Spanish Southwest into the United States Southwest—and just which indigenous and Spanish toponyms would be adopted or adapted in the conquest. </p>
<p>In some ways this military reconnaissance was also a scientific expedition. Lieutenant Emory and his team of topographical engineers were instructed to collect “data to give the government some idea of the regions traversed” when this did not interfere with more “immediate” military duties in service of Colonel Kearney’s command to “strike a blow at the northern provinces of Mexico, more especially New Mexico and California.” (7) Emory started from Washington with two box chronometers and two sextants, and picked up a barometer at Fort Leavenworth. Topographical sketches by either Lieutenant G.W. Peck or First Lieutenant W.H. Warner were the maps’ foundations (10). </p>
<p>The maps’ main emphasis was not to document the whole trip, but instead to present lesser-known routes to the West. In the report, which went into a second printing of 10,000 copies for the House and 250 for the authors, Emory identifies the route’s three zones, “distinct in character, climate and products”: From Fort Leavenworth (Missouri) to Pawnee Fork (Larned, Kansas), Pawnee Fork to Bent’s Fort (Colorado), and Bent’s Fort to Santa Fe (New Mexico) (1). The report provided the authors’ journal from the lesser known third segment, along with detailed illustrations of individuals and the landscape, botanical sketches, tables of astronomical and other measurements, and route and battle maps. Single-sheet sketch maps of the battles of San Pasqual (108), Rio San Gabriel (118) and Los Angeles (120) accompanied a textual description. Two large maps of the routes folded out at the end of the volume. </p>
<p>The battle sketch maps reveal the difficulty of making multiple movements (and moments) legible in a single sheet, as well as some of the process by which two crossed swords get on the map. The engagement between “Pico’s” and American forces at San Pasqual on December 6 and 7, 1848, clearly took place in two different locales, left at least some US soldiers dead (the map indicates the tree they are buried under) and wounded (a hospital is mentioned). Arrows, clear distinction of US and Mexican troops, and text explaining the sequence of Pico’s positions, who did what to whom, and how, the sequence of events takes a while to puzzle out. In the Battle of Los Angeles it seems that the Americans broke through Mexican lines to ford a river and have a clear shot at the town (pueblo) of Los Angeles, which they eventually captured as the map triumphantly notes. One map gives a little insight to the casualties of war, and the other to the mobility of troops on a battle ground and the role that a battle might play in achieving a final objective. Both treat the Mexican forces as a serious foe, if one that Americans overcame. </p>
<p>The first folding map, <em>Map of the Territory of New Mexico made by order of Brig. Gen. S.W. Kearny, under instructions from Lieut. W.H. Emory, UST.E by Lieut’s J.W Abert and W.G. Peck, UST.E, 1846-7</em>, seems to be a straightforward topographical map of New Mexico, a businesslike detailing of roads, mountains, rivers, and places to resupply with water. (“Table lands, with grama grass, but no running Water”) But closer look reveals some of the authors’ interests: There are “gold mountains” on the road from Albuquerque to Santa Fe. Upward-pointing crossed swords (so small as to be almost invisible) mark the road north from Santa Fe to Taos de Puebla, suggesting US victories. There are <em>two</em> roads heading into New Mexico from the east: One from Fort Bent in Colorado, and the other a “Camanche road” (sic) from Arkansas. And the lieutenants turn over the northwest and southwest corners of the map to Apache and Navajo Indians, respectively, suggest the US will have more swords to cross once their larger enemy is defeated. </p>
<p>The second, <em>A map of the territory of New Mexico made by order of Brig. Gen. S.W. Kearny, under instructions from Lieut. W.H. Emory, UST.E, by Lieuts J.W. Abert and W.G. Peck, US T. E. 1846-7</em>, is based on Peck’s topographical sketches and offers a geographic overview of the territory. This is a more informative, chattier, and more detailed route map by Lieut. Cooke, from “a point on the Grande river (where the road <em>should</em> cross)” to the Pimo Villages, where he joined Kearny’s forces. Cooke, too, worries about water, showing water sinks, noting “water here” or “no water.” At times he presents more explicit information such as “water for 50 animals,” “water by digging,” “rain water pools.” He notes a recommendation for a possibly new and “good route, if water is sufficient.” Cooke is a more complete observer of the communities he travels through, as well. His map differentiates between Indian and other villages; distances in miles between tents indicate paths traveled in a day.

Based in Charleston and backed with royal authority, Stuart also had access to the survey records of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. Under Stuart’s direction, Georgia’s Surveyor General Joseph Purcell finally compiled all of the treaty information, boundary surveys, and colonial surveys into this enormous manuscript map. </p>

Its most ambitious feature, however, is its attempt to plot the location of all major and minor villages of the Cherokee, Creek, Chickasaw, and Choctaw Indians, as well as their claimed hunting grounds. It is the only eighteenth-century map to attempt this and thus provides the clearest glimpse of Native geographies in the colonial era. </p>`;

Finlay’s maps and journals offer a detailed portrait of both communications and political unrest on the eve of the American Revolution. </p>
<p>Finlay set out from Quebec City in September 1773, traveling by canoe with a scout, two military officers, and several Native guides. This map, copied from Finlay’s own hand-drawn map when his journals were published in 1867, shows the first leg of his travels, with a proposed route for a new postal road from Quebec to “the Massachusetts Province,” or present-day Maine. Early in his journal, Finlay criticized the map-making abilities of his Abenaki guides, claiming, “It is impossible to guess distances from an Indian draft; that people have no idea of proportion.” But he also admitted his dependence on them. Every night, Finlay noted, their guide Mentowermet sketched out the next day’s route on birch bark, marking ponds, lakes, marshes, ascents and descents. “He was right in everything but distances,” Finlay wrote (5-6). </p>
<p>After reaching Fort Halifax (at the map’s bottom-left; it is now Winslow, Maine), Finlay traveled south by postal roads through New England to Philadelphia. Then he sailed to Charleston, South Carolina, where he began a journey northward to Virginia. Along the way, he interviewed postmasters and postal carriers, keeping careful record of routes and delivery times. Finlay discovered many Americans sending messages outside the postal system to avoid British postage or surveillance. Even official postal carriers were illegally taking on letters outside the mails for extra pay. Britain’s deep unpopularity in the colonies made it difficult to stop such practices. “Were any Deputy Post master to do his duty and make a stir in such matter,” Finlay wrote, “he would draw on himself the odium of his neighbors and be mark’d as the friend of Slavery and oppression and a declared enemy to America” (32). </p>
<p>Staunchly loyal to the British Crown, Finlay was rarely welcomed on his travels, and by June 1774 he feared enough for his safety that he cut his expedition short. After British authorities fired Benjamin Franklin for leaking documents to aid the colonial cause, Finlay was named to replace him as deputy postmaster for British North America. Within a few months, the American colonies were in open revolt. Finlay fled to Quebec, where he would serve as postmaster for the remaining British colonies until 1799 (Steele 1983). </p>`;

  return `<p>This striking map of North America was published in 1849 to capitalize on the California Gold Rush, which reached a fever pitch in that year. The Joseph Hutchins Colton Company was a leading publisher of maps in the mid-nineteenth century. Colton’s maps were expensive and attractive, known for their decorative borders and illustrations. They were printed using engraved steel plates and often colored individually by hand. This map was probably a pre-existing engraving of North America, adapted to show routes of travel and communication to the California gold fields. The mail routes were hand drawn with blue ink and the gold region highlighted in yellow watercolor. The interior of the map is also labeled, faintly, with the names of Native American tribes, some with numbers that may be estimated populations. </p>
<p>The Gold Rush gave many Americans their first opportunity to travel to, or communicate with someone on, the other side of the continent. This was no quick or easy task. The overland journey to California along the Oregon, Mormon, or Santa Fe Trails took three to seven months. A sea voyage around the southern tip of South America was marginally safer but no faster. Although the very fastest clipper ships might make the 15,000 mile trip in as little as one hundred days, voyages of four to eight months were more common. Sailing to Chagres, Panama and then crossing the continent at its narrowest point cut the distance to be traveled in half, but at the cost of an arduous jungle journey. Postal service between California and the eastern states was therefore slow, yet still more reliable than other means of communication. “Never send by private hand—not even if your own husband was the person,” one forty-niner warned his sister in 1850. “The person always dies along the way” (Henkin 2008, 124).</p>`;

  return `<p>This map shows one section of the first transcontinental telegraph line, which connected the eastern United States to California in 1861. The line was constructed by the Western Union Telegraph Company along with a consortium of California firms that formed the California State Telegraph Company, later the Overland Telegraph Company of California. Western Union’s telegraph to the Pacific followed the eastern portion of the Oregon Trail as far west as Wyoming, then ran southwest to Salt Lake City and across the desert to Carson City and Sacramento. This map shows the route of the telegraph between Salt Lake City and Austin, Nevada, the last portion of the line to be completed and probably the hardest to construct. </p>
<p>The map gives some sense of the harsh terrain to be traversed: mountain ranges, roads “passable only in summer,” and deserts “destitute of vegetation.” This last notation hints at one of the biggest challenges in building the line: finding trees with which to make telegraph poles. There were no suitable trees in the desert, so construction crews had to scour the mountains for miles around, sometimes hauling poles hundreds of miles to be erected. </p>
<p>Western Union secured help from the federal government to build this section of the line, along with the cooperation of the Shoshone and Paiute tribes of the Great Basin, and the Church of Latter Day Saints. The Mormons furnished Western Union with timber as well as labor, food, and transportation. Western Union paid the church $11,000 in gold for its aid, along with assistance in constructing a church-owned telegraph linking the main Mormon settlements (Arrington 1951). When the transcontinental line was completed, church leader Brigham Young was the first to send a message from Salt Lake City to San Francisco. </p>
<p>The telegraph to the Pacific made obsolete the Pony Express, a system of horses, riders, and relay stations established only eighteen months before. The Express could carry letters from Missouri to California in about ten days. In November 1860, its horses and riders broke all previous records when they brought news of Abraham Lincoln’s election to California only seven days and seventeen hours after it left the East Coast. But the telegraph was nearly instantaneous, and the Express lost money on every trip. Two days after the completion of the transcontinental telegraph in October 1861, the Pony Express suspended operations for good. </p>`;

  return `<p>This map celebrates the first transatlantic telegraph cable, completed in 1858. The submarine cable ran from Valentia Island, Ireland to Trinity Bay, Newfoundland, a distance of over 1,600 miles. The map shows the cable’s approximate path, along with steamship routes and a profile of the Atlantic’s depth. An inset depicts a “natural size” cross-section of the cable itself: seven copper wires wrapped in tarred hemp and covered in latex made from gutta-percha. The cable was about three quarters of an inch in diameter; each mile of cable weighed approximately one ton. </p>
<p>The transatlantic cable was the dream of Canadian telegrapher Frederick Newton Gisborne and American businessman Cyrus Field. Field financed the project with private investment and subsidies from both the British and United States governments. The first attempts to lay the submarine cable were made in 1857. But laying a 1,600 mile wire across the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean was no small feat. Two of the largest navy vessels in the world—one British, one American—were loaded with thousands of tons of wire. They met in the middle of the North Atlantic, connected their cables, then slowly sailed back to Ireland and Newfoundland, carefully unspooling the wire into the ocean as they went. When the cable snapped—as it did, several times—nothing could be done except to start all over again. After several failed attempts, a working cable reached both continents in August 1858. North America and Europe were joined in electrical communication. </p>
<p>Transmission, however, was far from instantaneous. It took an average of two minutes to send and receive a single character. President James Buchanan’s effusive telegram of congratulations to Queen Victoria took nearly eighteen hours to transmit. In trying to improve the quality of the signal, operators boosted the voltage of their transmitters well past the carrying capacity of the cable. The cable failed, permanently, after only twenty-three days of operation. Some skeptics charged that the telegraph had never worked, and was only an elaborate stock fraud. Almost a decade would pass before a second transatlantic cable was constructed in 1866.</p>`;

  return `<p>Before the middle of the nineteenth century, every town and city kept its own local time, based on the rising and setting of the sun. Travel and communication were slow enough that time discrepancies between different locations rarely mattered. Sailors and mapmakers needed the exact time to determine their longitude, but most other people hardly noticed differences in times. Indeed, in the eighteenth century and before, many clocks did not even have minute hands. </p>
<p>The railroad and the telegraph changed all this. For both efficiency and safety, railroads adopted single time standards to coordinate their operations. Britain’s railroads were the first to make this change. In 1847, all British railways agreed to adopt Greenwich Mean Time—that is, the mean solar time observed at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, London—which soon became known throughout Britain as “railway time.” </p>
<p>In North America, consolidation came slower. Each railroad typically adopted the local time of the largest city it served. Thus, the Pennsylvania Railroad ran on Philadelphia time, the New York Central ran on New York City time, and so on. Railway guides in the 1850s and 1860s listed between fifty and a hundred distinct railroad time systems. But as the industry consolidated, with smaller railroads merging or being taken over by larger firms, time zones gradually consolidated too. </p>
<p>By the 1880s, several plans for time reform had been advanced. Some reformers urged Americans to adopt a single national time zone for the entire country. (Tsar Alexander III decreed one single time for all of Russia in 1888, despite a difference in solar time of nearly nine hours from one end of the Russian Empire to the other.) In 1883, a convention of railroad presidents, managers, and superintendents voted to adopt five standard time zones for North America, each an hour apart. A map not unlike this one played a role in their deliberations. William F. Allen, the secretary of the railroads’ General Time Convention, displayed two maps: one showing the then-existing time systems as a multicolored patchwork quilt, the other showing the proposed time zones in five simple stripes (as shown here). Both maps were available for sale, Allen said, but the one depicting “current chaos” was too complicated to be mass produced and would therefore cost twice as much (Galison, 123-124). </p>
<p>This map, published six years after the adoption of standard time, provides a list of conversions back to the old solar times for many American cities. We see, for instance, that Eastern Standard Time is sixteen minutes slower than Boston’s solar time, but eight minutes faster than Washington, DC’s. The railroads could not require government or ordinary citizens to adopt their time standards (except when catching a train) and for a few years, some Americans did keep track of both solar and railroad times. But this was cumbersome, and people found little advantage to preserving two systems. In 1918, Congress passed the Standard Time Act, making official what was already true in practice. Railroad schedules had come to trump the sun in defining time itself. </p>`;

  return `<p>These maps of Ohio and Pennsylvania appeared in the 1899 edition of <em>Cram’s Standard American Railway System Atlas of the World</em>. The George F. Cram Company was one of the few firms to rival Rand McNally in the mapmaking industry of late-nineteenth century America. Both companies embraced new methods of mass production that made maps cheaper to produce, while the explosive growth of the railroads drove demand for their atlases and gazetteers. George Cram’s uncle had worked for Sidney Edwards Morse, brother of Samuel Morse and the inventor of wax engraving, a printing method that was faster and cheaper than traditional copperplate engraving. The Cram Company’s mass-produced atlases were less expensive than older atlases, even less expensive than Rand McNally’s works, and sold nationwide on trains and in stations, by mail order and direct subscription. </p>
<p>Cram’s name was apt. Wax-engraved maps could contain more detail than copperplate maps, and Cram’s atlases were typically crammed with tiny place names and other text. This map of Pennsylvania contains little information on topography or any natural features, but it shows 135 different railroads and more than a thousand towns and villages. These were reference works, not works of art, designed to meet the needs of bankers, brokers, and other businessmen. What these maps depict is the new economy of the late nineteenth century: A dense web of railroad lines and telegraph offices connecting virtually every town and hamlet in the East. (West of the Mississippi, the grid was not nearly so dense, although by 1899 this was changing.) The atlas also contained a detailed index of towns and cities, listing populations, the names and locations of banks, railroads and shipping companies, and post offices from which money orders could be sent or received. </p>
<p>Atlases like this one were, in the words of geographer John Rennie Short, “a depiction of the national economic space, a space that has been collapsed by the railroad system, the telegraph and the ability to make financial transactions” (Short 2001, 227). On the eve of the twentieth century, that economic space was indeed national, but not yet international. Despite its title, Cram’s “world” atlas focused primarily on American states and cities. In the 1890 edition of <em>Cram’s Unrivaled Atlas of the World</em>, 136 of 181 pages were devoted to the United States. This tension between local focus and international ambition was even more evident in the titles of state and regional atlases like <em>Cram’s Superior Reference Atlas of Michigan and the World</em> (Schulten 2001, 29). </p>`;

  return `<p>The Bell System dominated telecommunications in the United States for most of the twentieth century, but its monopoly was not inevitable. In the decades around 1900, ordinary citizens established tens of thousands of independent telephone systems. Some of these small systems competed directly with Bell for urban markets. Many more brought the telephone to small towns and rural areas that the Bell monopoly had not served. Competition sped construction and drove down the price of telephone service. The number of telephone users in the United States shot up from the thousands to the millions in just a few short years. </p>
<p>This 1905 map of independent toll lines in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania suggests a key difference between the Bell and independent approach. The Bell System, led by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T), promoted national integration through commerce. It staked its success on the long distance telephone, building a coast-to-coast long distance network that the independents never rivaled. Bell’s independent rivals questioned the importance of very long distance telephony. They focused instead on the sort of short and middle distance communication shown here, connecting towns to the farms and villages in their own hinterlands, and building regional networks that mapped onto the regional subsystems of the American economy. </p>
<p>What this map depicts is not, as one might imagine, a single, national system with New York or Chicago as its hub. (Note that the map does not show an independent exchange on the island of Manhattan. The Bell companies fought hard to protect their largest urban markets, and the independents struggled to gain a foothold in New York City.) Instead, the map presents a network of smaller networks, stitched together by dozens of small companies, connecting small and medium-sized towns. When Americans chose between installing an independent telephone or a Bell telephone (and they had to choose, or else install two telephones and pay two bills, because the competing networks were not interconnected) they were, in effect, choosing between an older economy characterized by regional, town-to-town commerce and a new economy of national markets and nation-spanning corporations. For a time, many Americans embraced the independent alternative. In 1907, more than half the six million telephones in the United States lay outside the Bell System. But AT&amp;T fought back, commercially, politically, and in the field of publicity and public opinion. By the 1920s, the independent telephone movement had been marginalized, and consumers as well as government regulators embraced AT&amp;T’s vision of one big national network. </p>`;

  return `<p>The world’s first commercial radio station was Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania’s KDKA, which made its maiden broadcast on election night, November 2, 1920. By the middle of the 1920s, the “radio craze” was in full swing. Hundreds of radio stations had been established, and millions of Americans were listening to the radio every day. This map, published by Rand McNally in 1926, shows how quickly Americans took to radio. It also captures the industry on the cusp of a transition, from hundreds of individual stations to a few national networks. </p>
<p>Early radio broadcasting was local in orientation and eclectic in content. The first commercial stations, like KDKA, were established by radio manufacturers to promote the sale of radio receivers. Then department stores and newspapers established stations to promote their wares. Soon, everyone wanted a radio transmitter. By 1926, there were nearly one thousand broadcasting stations in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, owned by a huge variety of businesses, churches, schools, and other groups. </p>
<p>This map divides the United States into thirteen radio districts, created by the Department of Commerce to license wireless operators in 1912—these districts are still used today in amateur radio licensing. It also distinguishes between government, commercial, and “broadcasting” stations—a large class of stations that were neither government-owned nor purely commercial in nature. On the map you can find large commercial stations like New York City’s WEAF, which became the flagship station of the National Broadcasting Corporation. But you can also find non-commercial stations like WDBZ, operated by a boy scout troupe in Kingston, New York; or WJBL, owned by a dry goods store in Decatur, Illinois; or KFAU, run by the students of Boise High School in Boise, Idaho. Some of the more colorful broadcasters became notorious well beyond their immediate locale. Quack doctor John Romulus Brinkley used his Kansas City station KFKB to promote the transplantation of goat testicles into humans as an impotence cure. Shreveport, Lousiana’s KWKH was the home of William “Doggone” Henderson, a forefather of the modern shock jock who harangued his listeners with streams of rustic invective. And in the tiny religious community of Zion, Illinois, Reverend Wilbur Voliva used his WCBD (the call letters stood for “Wilbur Can Beat the Devil”) to broadcast hellfire sermons and lectures on the flatness of the Earth. With the help of a 5,000-watt transmitter, massive for the time, Voliva reached an audience from Alaska to Bermuda, until federal regulators moved him to a less favorable radio frequency (Doerksen 2005). </p>
<p>In the year this map was published, Congress moved to regulate the babel of American radio with tighter control on radio licenses and a preference for “wholesome” and “high-minded” programming. The Radio Corporation of America struck a deal with AT&amp;T to link radio stations across the nation by wire, creating the first national radio network. Rural and regional interests fought against the consolidation of radio into national chains—“Doggone” Henderson was a particularly vocal enemy of “the chain gang”—but the financial clout of the new networks, the influence of federal regulators, and the mass appeal of commercial programming made the fight to preserve local radio a losing battle. </p>`;

  return `<p>This famous set of maps from Charles O. Paullin’s <em>Atlas of the Historical Geography of the United States</em> shows the increasing speed of travel and communication in the United States between 1800 and 1930. Paullin, a historian at the Carnegie Institution of Washington, and John K. Wright, a geographer at the American Geographic Society, spent more than twenty years producing the <em>Atlas</em>, completed in 1932. Eighty years after its publication, it remains a classic work of historical geography, with more than 700 attractive and authoritative maps on a wide range of historical topics. </p>
<p>Perhaps the most commonly reproduced maps in the Atlas are the five maps here showing “Rates of Travel.” The contour lines on each map are called “isochrones,” lines connecting points at which things arrive or occur at the same time. Paullin and his team used dozens of historical sources to construct these maps, along with some artful estimation. They reveal not one but several revolutions in communication and transportation: the expansion of postal roads, the development of the steamboat, and the construction of the Erie Canal between 1800 and 1830; the spread of the railroads east of the Mississippi between 1830 and 1857; the completion of the transcontinental railroads and the beginning of air travel between 1857 and 1930. Other maps on the page depict in geographic space what the isochrones describe in time. (Plate H, showing postal roads and stage routes in 1774, was based primarily on Hugh Finlay’s maps and journals, described above (Map #2).) The arrangement of these maps suggests the successive, cumulative force of change. In 1857, for example, one could travel from New York to St. Louis in about three days—a pace that would have seemed slow by the standards of Paullin’s day but astonishingly fast a century before. </p>
<p>Paullin’s splendid maps do distort the past in at least one way: New York City in the early 1800s was not the center of American communications in the way it would be by 1932. In the early nineteenth century, the US communications infrastructure was far more polycentric than it would later become, with distinct regional networks and sharp variations from place to place. But an isochrone map needs a center, and such simplification hardly detracts from this classic piece of data visualization. </p>`;

  return `<p>The Gulf Stream is a powerful ocean current that flows up the coast of North America from Florida towards Newfoundland before bending east to cross the Atlantic. Sailors had noticed the current for centuries—the Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León observed it in 1513—but Benjamin Franklin was the first to name “the Gulph Stream” and map it in its totality. His position at the center of transatlantic communications networks made it possible for him to do so. </p>
<p>On his first voyage from America to Europe, in 1726, Franklin had noticed “gulph weed” floating far from shore in the waters of the North Atlantic. Twenty years later, he observed that letters mailed from America to Europe got there faster than letters mailed from Europe to America. At the time he speculated that this might have to do with the rotation of the earth. In 1753, Franklin went to London to serve as deputy postmaster for Britain’s North American colonies. As postmaster, Franklin came to wonder why British mail ships took as much as two weeks longer to sail west from Cornwall to New York than ships sailing a similar distance east from Rhode Island to London. He consulted with merchant and whaling captains, including his cousin Timothy Folger, and realized the mail ships were fighting against the ocean’s current. </p>
<p>Together, Folger and Franklin prepared this map of the Gulf Stream and distributed it to British mail ships in 1769 or 1770, hoping that “such Chart and directions may be of use to our Packets in Shortening their Voyages.” This particular copy was reprinted in 1787. When their map is compared to modern satellite images of ocean temperatures, it is remarkable how accurately Franklin and Folger depicted the Gulf Stream’s path. On his next two voyages across the Atlantic, in 1775 and 1776, Franklin measured water temperatures along the way and confirmed the presence of a wide, warm current (Johnson 2008, 9-11). By then, of course, Franklin was no longer in the service of the British Crown.</p>`;
