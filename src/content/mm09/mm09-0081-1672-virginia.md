Lederer’s map was attached to the published account of his journey, _The Discoveries of John Lederer,_ published in London in 1672. Lederer’s original journal (in Latin) and map were transmitted and prepared for publication by William Talbot, Provincial Secretary for Maryland. Originally part of a company of Virginia colonists interested in exploring trade opportunities with Southeastern Indians, Lederer found himself alone after the Virginians abandoned him. He then continued his long trek southward accompanied by a Susquehannock Indian guide familiar with, but not native to, the region. Lederer’s map influenced the mapping of the Southeast for many years to come.
