Moll’s map was a direct response to Guillame De Lisle’s _Carte Nouvelle de la Louisiana_, published in Paris in 1718. Moll, a German mapmaker working in England, took exception on behalf of his adopted country to De Lisle’s assertions of French dominion over all of North American west of the Appalachians and north of Spanish Florida. Moll reproduced much, but not all, of the information from De Lisle’s map in order to stir Britain towards a more vigorous defense against France’s ambitious claims.
