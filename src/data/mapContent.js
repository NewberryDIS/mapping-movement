      'For some years after Columbus crossed the Atlantic Ocean, in 1492, Spanish activity in the New World was confined to the area of the Caribbean Sea. But then, after the discovery of the immense riches of Mexico in 1519, there began a feverish period during which Spanish leaders intensively explored other parts of the New World, hoping to find wealth to compare with that of central America. In this, they were spectacularly successful in South America, though not in the region north of Mexico. This period of expansion was accompanied by a burst of mapping, which attempted to record the Spaniards’ newfound lands.',
      'This map by Domingo del Castillo (originally manuscript) dated from that time (1541), though this printed copy may be found in the Historia de la Nueva-España published at Mexico City in 1770. That town (“La ciudad de Mexico”) may be seen at the lower right, quite far from its true location. It counterbalances “La ciudad de Cibola” at the upper left; this was the legendary if imaginary city of Cibola, a rich prize which the Spaniards spent much time and money pursuing, in vain. Castillo, who compiled the map during the expedition of Alarcón (1540-1542), was a pilot while the expedition thoroughly investigated the coastline, and sailed twice up the Colorado River (top left).',
      'Baja California is correctly shown as a peninsula, though it would thereafter often be shown as an island, and the abundance of place-names on the east coast of the Gulf of California—very few of which survive—shows that the Spaniards were in the process of settling this area, for which they had what turned out to be unrealistically high expectations. What we now call the “Pacific Ocean” was then known as the “Mar del Sur,” because it had first been identified by Vasco Nuñez de Balboa (c. 1475-1517) as he looked southwards from the Isthmus of Panama.',
      'Castillo inserts figures for latitude down the left margin, and these have stood the test of time. In the absence of any way of calculating the time elapsed from the start of the voyage (a weakness eventually corrected by the advent of marine chronometers), chartmakers of his day were not able accurately to calculate figures of longitude (the east-westerly direction). This weakness would for many years reduce the precision of maps produced by European explorers.',

      'After consolidating ther hold on the Caribbean, the Spaniards explored the land to the north of the Gulf of Mexico. Alvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca (c. 1485-c. 1559) led an expedition there between 1528 and 1536, and this was followed by the expedition of Hernando de Soto (1496-1542), which ranged over vast distances between 1539 and 1543. The De Soto expedition generated a particularly full manuscript map of the huge area covered, and this map then became the source for the printed map of the area found in the 1584 edition of Abraham Ortelius’s great atlas, the Theatrum Orbis Terrarum.',
      'Our map draws from these precursors, as well as others, and is the work of “a public servant with an interest in geography,” as R.A. Skelton puts it. Wytfliet had compiled an atlas of nineteen maps showing various parts of the New World, oddly titling it as an addition to the works of Ptolemy. There is no evidence that Wytfliet had access to any unpublished information; he simply relied on the standard and readily available printed works. His atlas thus resembled other collections of maps and texts of the late sixteenth century by enterprising entrepreneurs like Giovanni Battista Ramusio, Theodor de Bry, and Richard Hakluyt.',
      'The original manuscript map by Alonso de Santa Cruz had shown a great variety of more or less fanciful rivers emptying into the Gulf of Mexico; it also inserted a large number of indigenous settlements. The printed version by Ortelius and Wytfliet greatly simplified the manuscript map, leaving out many of the settlements and rivers. It nevertheless succeeded in offering a good general impression of the area, complete with figures of latitude and longitude, the latter fairly imprecise.',
      'Prominent among the rivers flowing into the Gulf is the “R. de S. Spirito,” which from its size and position must surely be an attempt to show the Mississippi River. “Florida” at the time was often shown as occupying the whole southern area of what is now the United States; the prominence of “Apalche” commemorates the ill-known Indian group known as the “Apalachee,” described by Cabeza de Vaca. The careful delineation of Cuba and the Bahama Islands reflects early Spanish knowledge of that area.',

      'Like the English, the French were long deterred by the presence of Spaniards from attempting to settle in the more welcoming parts of the New World. In the 1530s Jacques Cartier (1489-1557) did make several attempts to establish a colony on the Saint Lawrence River; he was eventually repulsed not by the Spaniards but by the severity of the climate. In the 1560s colonies were briefly established in what is now Florida by Jean Ribaut and René de Laudonnière, but these rapidly failed, in the face of intense Spanish opposition. After that, from about 1560 to 1600 the people in France were much diverted by the wars of religion.',
      'Permanent French settlement of the Saint Lawrence valley would be the work of Samuel de Champlain (c. 1570-1635), whose Canadian venture began in 1603, with the powerful support of king Henri IV (1589-1610) He was an explorer of remarkable tenacity, who understood not only the limitations of his French companions, but also the need to adapt to the peculiarly difficult circumstances of the Saint Lawrence valley. He also had to contend against the arguments of men like Sully, Henry IV’s all-powerful minister, who contended that “great riches are never found in places above forty degrees of latitude.”',
      'Champlain was a remarkable cartographer, who compiled many detailed maps, some of which were printed in his book, Les voyages du sieur de Champlain (Paris, 1613). He used these small-area manuscript maps to compile maps of much larger areas, like this Carte de la nouvelle France. It is extraordinary that a cartographer of the period could in ten years have compiled so extensive and precise a map, largely relying on his own travels and observations by land and sea, supplemented by what he could learn from Indian informants. The map begins to show weakness only in the far west, where Champlain still hoped that the rumored great body of water (“grand lac”) might lead directly to China.',
      'This map also testifies to Champlain’s intense interest in the people and products of the country. He inserted four Indian figures, two of whom the engraver has made distinctly European in appearance; the right-hand couple’s facial features unmistakably resemble those of king Henri IV and his wife, Marie de Medici. He also drew and named a remarkable variety of indigenous fruits and vegetables. Champlain had learned his cartographic skills in the service of Henri IV (1589-1610) as lodgings-master, responsible for sketching out the towns and villages in which a French army on the march might be quartered. In this kind of mapping, essentially carried out out using pacing and map-bearings, Champlain would not have used references to latitude and longitude, which indeed are lacking from this great map.',

      'This map is a good example of the direct relationship between exploratory surveys and the subsequent cartography. It was the work of John Smith (1580-1631), soldier and leading figure in the English settlement of Virginia. He had spent three months in 1608 surveying the area from a small boat, and then gave the manuscript work, which must have been very detailed, to William Hole for engraving back in England.',
      'The map is oriented westwards, with north at the right, and gives a remarkable impression of the rivers running into “Chesapeack” Bay. Smith ascended most of them, charting their course until the point (marked by a cross) at which the rest was “had by information of the Savages, and are set down according to their instructions.” Smith noted about 200 Indian settlements, often with such accuracy that his observations have helped recent archeological investigators; these Indian place-names find their place among some emergent English names. Smith inserted figures of both latitude (along the top) and of longitude, the latter running (contrary to later practice) from west to east (and not from Greenwich westwards).',
      'Like many printed maps of the period, this one contains much imagery that is not original. Both the engraving of “Powhatan” (top left) and that of the Indian armed with a bow come originally from the drawings of John White, who had led an expedition to the area in 1587; these images were subsequently adopted by Theodor de Bry in his A Briefe and True Report of the New Found Land of Virginia (Frankfort, 1590), from which Smith copied them.

      'Once the French had begun to establish themselves around Québec, royal policy was not in favor of over-extending their power into the unknown west. However, this came about in any case through the efforts of voyageurs, seeking furs, and missionaries, seeking souls for conversion. By 1669 Father Claude Allouez (1622-1689) had reached the present site of the town of Green Bay, where he founded the “Mission St François Xavier,” named after an early Jesuit.',
      'It was probably Father Allouez, perhaps in collaboration with Father Claude Dablon, who drew the manuscript original of our remarkable map, which appeared in the printed Jesuit Relations of 1672. This was a yearly published account of the work of the Jesuits in the mission field; it was widely disseminated in France, and served to attract support for the mission work.',
      'Whereas Samuel de Champlain had learned his cartographic skill in the service of the king, the Jesuits learned to draw maps in the course of their standard education, which was heavy in the natural sciences, including astronomy and cosmography. Many of their maps—and they were numerous throughout the Americas—were therefore composed with a theoretical background involving, for instance, the use of celestial observations. Their observations of latitude were quite precise, though they could not as yet accurately calculate longitude, even though they were well aware in of how this could be done.',
      'The map shows how the Jesuits were penetrating the Great Lakes by establishing missions at the nodal points. Thus on Lake Superior there were missions at the western end (“Mission du Saint Esprit,” near Duluth) and at the eastern end (“Sainte-Marie du Sault,” near Sault-Sainte-Marie). At the north end of Lake Michigan (the “Lac des Illinois’) was the “Mission de Saint-Ignace” (near the present town of Saint-Ignace), and at the southern end of Green Bay the “Mission Saint François Xavier.” Some of these missions were destroyed, and others changed location, but they were in general the centers from which the Jesuits came to understand their new mission territory. It was, for instance, from the “Mission Saint-Ignace” that Louis Joliet and Father Jacques Marquette set out in 1673 to trace the course of the Mississippi River. The prominent royal arms reminds us of the close relationship between church and state in French Canada.',

      'This map, with its Italian nomenclature, was the work of Vincenzo Coronelli (1650-1718), a Franciscan friar from Venice who first became famous for constructing two huge manuscript globes—one of the earth and one of the heavens—for the French King Louis XIV in Paris. Returning to Venice, Coronelli established in his convent a huge globe-manufacturing enterprise, in which he collected information, trained engravers and instructed workmen in the art of attaching the segments, or “gores,” so skillfully to the basic globes that it was hard to detect the seams.',
      'The present map is in fact a gore designed for a forty-two-inch globe, and includes the latest information about the cartography of North America. Hudson Bay and the Great Lakes are now known in general outline, and Coronelli has been able to include figures not only of latitude but also of longitude (see the figures across Hudson Bay). Colored lines mark the extent of the English settlement on the east coast, and of the Spaniards in the greatly expanded “Florida;” much of the rest of North America forms part of French “Canada.”',
      'Coronelli has done his best, using small images drawn from a variety of other publications, to show the activities of some of the indigenous inhabitants. Sometimes these are rather incongruous, like the person in the hammock (upper left) somewhere in the inhospitable northern fastness, or the New England-style palisaded villages down in what is now New Mexico (lower left). He has clearly been impressed by tales of alligators by the lower Mississippi River.',
      'The great weakness of this map is its westerly displacement, by about 300 miles, of the north-south course of the Mississippi River. The Jesuit map of the Great Lakes (see previous map) had given Lake Superior too long a westward extension, and the maps generated by Joliet in the later 1670s had compounded the problem by greatly exaggerating the length of the rivers, particularly the Illinois River, connecting the Mississippi River to the Great Lakes system. No wonder that working off an assumption like this, when La Salle tried to sail from the West Indies to the mouth of the Mississippi River, he ended up in an inhospitable region of Texas, where he perished in 1687. This was a good example of the way in which maps can mislead explorers.',

Moreover, Lahontan’s illustrations of a longhouse and a canoe seem to be a combination of objects found among Eastern tribes and in the Great Lakes. However, there is no denying that the “Rivière Longue” generally follows the line of the Missouri River, or that the map shows across the western mountains (near the “Pays des Gnasitares”) another great river (presumably the Columbia) leading to the Pacific Ocean. Lahontan clearly did not personally explore all these water-courses, but he may well have learned of them from informants among the Indian peoples, with whom he was notably familiar.',
      'Lahontan’s work was highly influential. His books were translated into English, Dutch, German and Italian, and elements of this map were copied by the leading cartographers of the day.

Vitus Bering’s voyage of 1728, tracked on this map, had established that Asiatic Russia ended at the strait now named after him. But there remained a great gap between Bering Strait and the Spanish settlement in California.',

On the coast north of California, there is mention of the shadowy English claim to “New Albion,” and then, north of that, some indication of the “River of the West,” which is the Columbia River.

Spaniards had long been established on the Rio Grande, as far north as Santa Fe, and there were French settlements along the great arc of inland waterways, from New Orleans to Québec, passing through the Great Lakes. English settlements had pushed westward to the mountain barrier of the Appalachians, though here for the time being they had been halted, both by the terrain and by the disinclination of the British government to allow further westward expansion into lands occupied by indigenous peoples.',
      'With the conclusion of the Revolutionary War, the British impediment to settlement across the Appalachians was removed, and our map belongs exactly to that period. It was drawn by John Filson (c. 1747-1788), who was himself part of the expansion, having acquired lands in Kentucky about 1783, the year of the Peace of Paris, ending the war between Great Britain and the newly-United States. The very next year, Filson published The Discovery, Settlement and Present State of Kentucke, which was accompanied by this map. This account of frontier possibilities proved extremely popular, appearing in both French (1785) and German (1790) editions. Its tone was set by the appendix describing the adventures of Daniel Boone, the very model of the frontiersman.',

Boon’s.” Louisville has emerged to the west, on the Ohio River, and the “explanation” at the top lists the objects of interest in an emergent territory; not only towns and mills, but also “salt springs,” “licks” and “wigwams.” Maps like this were a powerful incentive to draw both residents and immigrants into the process of westward expansion, for they projected the image of a settled country, in which new settlers could easily imagine themselves selecting a promising site.

As yet, however, no European map had succeeded in joining these two regions cartographically.',
      'This would be the work of Andrew Mackenzie (1764-1820). Born in Scotland, he emigrated to North America in 1774. Beginning in New York, in 1778 he went to work for a fur-trading company in Montréal. In 1785 he was sent north to Athabasca, and four years later founded Fort Chipewyan, seen on our map where the yellow track joins the red. Mackenzie was very curious to know how the Pacific Ocean might be reached from this site, and in 1789 set out on an exploratory voyage (see the northerly red track), in which he ended up, to his dismay, on the Arctic Ocean.',
      'One of his problems on his voyage had been the difficulty of accurately calculating longitude, and in 1791 he went for advice to London, where he bought a chronometer. This was of great use on his second voyage (1792-3), in which he successfully traversed the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Ocean, emerging at Bella Coola (now in British Columbia). Mackenzie thus showed the way to the Pacific Ocean ten years before the better-known travels of Lewis and Clark (1805-6), publishing his work in 1801 with the title Voyages from Montreal on the River St. Lawrence. Unlike many explorers, he successfully returned to his native land, Scotland, and enjoyed a long and prosperous retirement.',

      'Matthew Carey was a Philadelphia print shop owner and one of the most active map publishers in the early republic, operating from 1785 onward. His first map was published in 1794 and his first American Atlas in 1795 as a supplement to his edition of William Guthrie’s geography textbook. Carey turned his business over to his son Henry and son-in-law Isaac Lea in 1822, who turned away from cartographic publishing after Matthew’s retirement. This edition of the Atlas therefore represents the end of Carey’s cartographic legacy and the transition from Matthew’s stewardship to his son’s.',
      'This sheet, detached from the Atlas, presents a map of Georgia surrounded by historical, geographical and statistical information about the state. The map itself seems almost entirely copied (albeit simplified) from Daniel Sturges’s 1818 map of Georgia (unsurprising given that Sturges’s map was printed by Philadelphian John Melish and thus would have been known to the city’s printers and mapmakers). The text along the map’s edges names principal towns, political information, and economic data as well as some historical narrative. The goal here was to provide less ambiguous celebration of national expansion than even Sturges provided, directing the Atlas’s users in all the ways to celebrate Georgia’s accomplishments as demonstrated on the map.',

      'Samuel Augustus Mitchell’s map company in many ways reflected the era in which it became one of the United States’ leading map publishers. Mitchell himself was neither an engraver nor a mapmaker but he organized a business that could mass-produce maps for an expanding nation that needed to figure out where it was going. (Ristow 1985 303, 309) Mitchell’s company published numerous atlases and a long series of “Tourist’s Pocket Maps” in the decades before the Civil War. This map of the Carolinas and Georgias was not labeled as a “pocket map” but another copy at the University of Georgia indicates that the map originally folded and was attached to a cover, making it convenient for travel. Certainly the map user who inked his path through the antebellum South used it for travel purposes.',
      'This colorful map guides the user through the Carolinas and Georgia, emphasizing county divisions through coloration and marking stage, steamboat, and railroad routes through the region. The tables on the map’s edges list principal travel routes, their frequency, and their duration so that the traveler could plan how long the trip might take.',
      'What separates this copy of Mitchell’s map from many others still in existence is that this is a travel map actually marked by the traveler. Marked maps are difficult to find and it makes this map unique as it almost certainly accompanied the unknown traveler on his trip through the Carolinas and Georgia into Alabama (and possibly further).',

      'The Civil War seriously taxed America’s mapmaking capacities. The rapid advances in cartographic printing under companies like S. Augustus Mitchell’s were still no match for the demands of supplying up-to-date information on American roads and topography to armies in the field. The United States thus had to mobilize whole departments in the Army Corps of Engineers and the War Bureau to produce maps. The development of lithographic printing greatly aided this mobilization, with stone more quickly and easily accepting the information from manuscript maps that the more laborious steel plates of the antebellum age. The United States had its own lithographic presses but still needed to contract with commercial firms such as Julius Bien and Company in New York, who produced this map.',
      'Part of a collection of campaign maps the Newberry acquired as part of the collections of Union General Orville Babcock, this map and the others in the Babcock papers demonstrate the speed of such productions, with this map containing printed 1864 updates to a 1863 base map of northwestern Georgia. It was perhaps the most detailed map of this area of Georgia up to this point. Certainly it was the most detailed map of Georgia made since William Bonner’s 1851 Map of the State of Georgia. The careful attention paid to secondary roads and small towns provides a rich detail of where people lived and how they moved through the state in the middle decades of the nineteenth century.',

Unlike other advocates of the “good roads” movement, the NHA believed that a scattered system of state paved roads was less serviceable than a federally-funded and -directed system of highways. (Akerman 2006, 177) The NHA’s state maps therefore have two main, somewhat contradictory, purposes: To present state road systems as hopelessly complex and fragmented and to demonstrate at the same time how easily a federal system could be overlaid atop the existing state infrastructure to give order to the chaos.',

Small dirt roads and old stage routes that possibly had not appeared on Georgia map since the Civil War now became visible again, even small dirt county roads. This map thus offers an incredible amount of visual detail on the roadways and travel routes of Georgia in the early twentieth century.

Impossible to actually chart the acceptance of scientific belief, Cappon and his co-editors relied on the travels of the naturalists John and William Bartram to represent the physical movement of ideas.

      'Don Bernardo de Miera y Pacheco (1713-1785) was an accomplished explorer and skilled cartographer and a captain in the Spanish Royal Corps of Engineers, founded by a royal decree of Felipe V of the new Spanish Bourbon Dynasty in 1711 to help rebuild his war-torn empire. These soldier-engineers were to be well schooled in mathematics, field astronomy, and map making. The Corps came to represent what was understood as scientific mapping, and in northern New Spain engineers such as Miera were adjunct to presidios and other military forces on the frontier. They surveyed geographical details that could be observed directly and more and more came to discount local hearsay information; they also were the first accurately to map the roads of the American West. The tradition they established  was built upon and advanced by Mexican and US soldier-engineers throughout the nineteenth century.',
      'The principle purpose of the Dominguez-Escalante Expedition was to find a way, what would become the Old Spanish Trail, between Santa Fe and Monterey in Alta California. They penetrated west through what is now New Mexico and Colorado into Utah to Laguna de los Timpanangos (Utah Lake), before being forced south into Arizona by a massive blizzard and a shortage of food and supplies and then back to Santa Fe, traveling a total of more than 1,800 miles. Miera’s map incorporates the geographical and anthropological data from the expedition with what the Spanish already knew about these lands and as such is one of the most important maps of the American West and is an important source for the later maps of New Spain by Alexander von Humboldt and Zebulon Montgomery Pike, among others. It shows many of the discoveries made by the fathers and Miera, including Laguna Miera (Lake Sevier) in Arizona, and uses crosses on circles to mark the daily progress of the expedition. It also offers the first European depiction of the Upper Colorado River Basin and the lakes and streams of the eastern Great Basin.',
      'This map is a later copy of the original map completed by Miera in 1777 that was sent with Escalante’s Diario Derrotero of the expedition to the viceroy of New Spain in Mexico City. Miera also prepared a report, detailing his recommendations for the placement of future presidios to combat the Indian threat to Western New Mexico. The originals of both maps are in the British Library, and The Newberry Library has photographic copies in its Karpinski Collection. Louis C. Karpinski (1878-1956) was a professor of mathematics at the University of Michigan and an enthusiastic student of North American cartography. While on leave, in 1926 he photographed more than 700 American-related maps in European archives, about 180 of them Spanish and four by Miera. He produced six sets of fine eleven-by-seventeen-inch black-and-white prints of these maps and donated them to six American research libraries, among them The Newberry Library, to make them more readily available to map researchers.',

      'Friedrich Wilhelm Heinrich Alexander Freiherr von Humboldt (1769-1859) was a polymath, a dominant virtuoso intellectual—naturalist, geographer, explorer, philosopher, diplomat, and author—and a transitional figure of the later Enlightenment and early Romantic eras. In 1799-1804, Humboldt, armed with royal permits from the otherwise secretive Spanish, explored, researched, and collected specimens in the lands of Venezuela, the Oronoco River Basin, Cuba, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Mexico. Some the findings of this extensive journey were detailed in Humboldt’s Essai Politique sur Royaume de Nouvelle Espagne…, published in Paris in 1809 and London in 1810. Accompanying this account was an atlas of finely engraved relevant maps by Humboldt, including a major map of New Spain and this one of El Camino Real, which is actually a detail of the New Spain map. He did not actually explore northern New Spain, so these maps were in part based on research done in Paris, Madrid, Seville, Mexico City (where he probably encountered Bernardo de Miera y Pacheco’s cartography), and elsewhere.',
      'This is the first thoroughly detailed, widely disseminated printed map of the eastern branch of this main road system of the early American West. The route is detailed in three segments, from Santa Fe south to Chihuahua, Chihuahua to Durango, and Durango to Mexico City respectively. Reminiscent of the Spanish derroterros, which were its principle sources, it depicts only the surveyed road and its immediate environs. From this map it is clear that the route was significantly governed by the availability of water. Thus, north of Paseo del Norte (present-day El Paso-Juarez) the road essentially followed the Rio Grande Valley to Santa Fe. Several lakes too are prominently indicated all along the way. Mountains, mesas, and other particularly difficult terrains are circumvented where possible. Mexican and Indian pueblos on the itinerary are specified. And in Mexico, connecting east-west arteries are shown.',
      'Humboldt’s cartography had a significant impact on the later mapping of the American West. For example, on his way back to Europe he stopped off in Washington, DC and left a manuscript copy of his New Spain map with his friend President Thomas Jefferson.  The information on this map was made available to Lieutenant Zebulon Montgomery Pike in preparation for his tour of exploration into the southern Louisiana Purchase in 1806-1807 and appeared on Pike’s own crucial map of New Spain, published in Philadelphia in 1810. Since Pike had explored much of northern New Spain, his map was partially more accurate than Humboldt’s. Both helped to further open up the West, and Humboldt’s maps, especially this one of El Camino Real, were still respected and of value to the American military almost four decades later at the time of the Mexican-American War.',

In 1831, he began issuing pocket maps and guides of the United States and its territories for travelers. Mitchell likewise specialized in meeting the growing demand for geographical information about the West with high quality, mass market lithographed maps such as this one of his masterpieces. Published along with a forty-six page explanatory “Accompaniment” booklet into which it was folded, this map was one of the first depicting Texas as oversized state (with an extended panhandle) in the expanding United States. As it states in its extended title, this map is “compiled from the most recent authorities,” such as the cartography of Lewis and Clark, Zebulon Pike, John C. Frémont, William H. Emory, among others. It was both popular and influential because of what it said about the West to an increasing and eager viewership. While working as a teacher Mitchell had found himself frustrated by the lack of good maps in the classroom. The numbers in which his maps such as this were produced at reduced costs also helped to alleviate that problem at least somewhat as well. Interest in this map also undoubtedly was heightened by beginning of Mexican-American War in 1846, the year of its publication.',

      'This map, prepared for and published by the Kansas and Pacific Railway, is both functional and promotional. It provides a summary of the great cattle trails stretching from Texas north to the Kansas railheads. Most of the trails are shown at least in part in a network but are individually unnamed. And what is prominently labeled as the “Ellsworth Cattle Trail” generally follows the more famous Chisholm Trail laid down by Texas rancher Jesse Chisholm. On the other hand, “J.S. Chisum’s Trail” shown in New Mexico is actually that pioneered by the Lincoln County rancher John Chisum. In this regard, the map is advertising Kansas Pacific Railway’s availability to the routes of the cattle trails. These are clearly marked routes to be followed by ranchers to market their beef east and west.',
      'This map also can be seen as a booster map and a souvenir intended to promote the Kansas Pacific Railway in general. It was issued folded inside of the back cover of a guide to the Railway and trails leading to it. The delightful title cartouche of a Texas longhorn steer with the Railway’s name on a banner spanning its magnificent horns and the title of the map on a Texas lone star badge hanging from a ring in the steer’s nose clearly underscores the map’s publicity function.

      'One of the most important technologies in the history of maritime navigation is the compass, a device based on the fact that the earth has a distinct magnetic field, and that magnetized materials will tend to line up in parallel to the lines of the local magnetic field. Sometime around 1000 CE, magnetic needle compasses that could be used on ships were developed in China, and spread rapidly around the world. From the beginning, it was noted that compass needles pointed only generally north and south, and that the difference in direction, or deviation, of the compass needle changed slowly as one traveled. With further experience with compasses, it was realized that the deviation of a compass that never moved from one spot changed as well, although very slowly.',
      'In 1701, Edmund Halley synthesized his own observations of the deviation of the compass over the expanse of the South Atlantic ocean, and combined them with the observations of the much more frequently traveled North Atlantic, to create what is in some ways a three-dimensional model of the earth’s magnetic field, in which the major lines of magnetic force above the planet are projected down onto the surface. Halley developed the very first isogonic lines to represent the deviation of the magnetic field from true north-south orientation. The central undulating line represents the thin zone where compass needles actually do point north-south. West of that line, compass needles point east of north, and east of the line compass needles point west of true north. All points along any of Halley’s isogonic lines will have the same deviation from true north-south.',
      'There are small steady changes in deviation over years everywhere, called secular variation. It is conjectured that the slow circulation of molten metal in the earth’s core and aesthenosphere are the causes of secular variation. Several decades after the publication of his first map, secular variation had changed enough that Halley researched and then published a revised second edition of his map, in 1732.',

      'Sometime around 1800, Edmund Blunt began a partnership with Nathaniel Bowditch (1773-1838) who was a mathematical prodigy and master of navigational sciences born into an ancient seafaring family in Salem, Massachusetts. They schemed to create a new, improved edition of another British navigational authority, The New Practical Navigator, being an Epitome of Navigation, which had been written by John Hamilton Moore (1738-1807), who was a skilled British mathematician and innovator in navigational techniques. Captain Lawrence Furlong’s American Coast Pilot was primarily addressed to coast-wise navigation along the American coast, and the intricacies of sailing in and out of complex harbor channels, etc. Moore’s Epitome of Navigation was a general treatise on celestial navigation, determining latitude and longitude at sea by reference to astronomical positioning, and particularly to improved methods to determine a ship’s longitude, by use of tables of the projected positions of the Moon at specific future times and dates as experienced at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich.',
      'Blunt and Bowditch’s Chart of the Atlantic Ocean features a compass rose in the approximate center of the Western Ocean, or North Atlantic. The chart also has some arrows showing consistent ocean current direction, and a great arc, named as “The Trade Wind” which is more accurately described as the course of the Gulf Steam flowing from the south and then east towards the coast of northwestern Europe. The chart also shows the track of a ship’s voyage from Boston Harbor into and along the great arc, and then directly east to the Portuguese island of Madeira, southwest of the Iberian Peninsula. That journey was accompanied by a complete journal of the process of navigating from Boston to Madeira, written to illustrate most or all of the navigational techniques presented by Bowditch. In that era, there were copyright laws in force in both Great Britain and the United States, although they varied from our present legal conceptions of copyright a good deal. But in any case, a way of making the case that a new edition of somebody else’s book didn’t violate copyrights to the book was to make additions and improvements to it. The original British editions of Moore’s New Practical Navigator taught his navigational techniques through a journal of a voyage from London to the island of Tenerife, in the Canary Islands off the coast from the western Sahara in Africa. Bowditch’s version voyaged from Boston to Madeira, and hence was “new, and improved!”',
      'The 1807 edition of “the Bowditch” also includes illustrations of the three major instruments of navigation as used in the western tradition in that era: (1) The mariners compass, with its thirty-two-point divisions, the compass rose, here mounted on gimbals in a box, to compensate for the rocking movements of the ship; (2) Equipment to determine the speed of the ship, consisting of an hourglass for timing, and a spool on which line can be wound, and a “log,” which when thrown overboard off the back end of the ship attached to the line, will tend to stay in the same place in the water, while the ship moves forward and the line runs out, until the moment the hourglass empties. The length of the line unrolled during the time of the hourglass can then be converted into an estimate of the speed of the ship; and (3) Two versions of the general class of angle-measuring instruments called, generally, quadrants. Isaac Newton (1642-1727) actually devised the concept for a celestial angle measuring device using double-reflecting mirrors, a description of which he gave to Edmond Halley. This was not published until after Halley’s death in 1742, by which time a British mathematician, John Hadley (1682-1744), and an American optician and inventor, Thomas Godfrey (1704-1749) had, about 1730, independently invented their own versions of the instrument. Well into the next century, the instruments were commonly known as Hadley’s quadrants. In the Bowditch image, the instrument on the left is described as a quadrant, although it is more properly an octant, as its curved arc represents an eighth of a circle, or forty-five degrees. The instrument in the right is a sextant, with an arc of sixty degrees, or a sixth of a circle. With this general class of instrument, it is possible to measure the angle between two celestial objects reasonably accurately, by day or night, from the deck of a moving ship, which is an extraordinary achievement. This triad of instrument systems for determining the direction, speed, and position of a ship became universal in the western traditions of navigation until the twentieth century and the advent of radio systems and electronic instruments. Even now, in the absence of electronics, the triad still works well.',

      'Although it may seem obvious, coast-wise and maritime navigation is entirely constrained by the type and capabilities of the boats and ships used to navigate. Boats and ships should float, of course, and should allow propulsion, which means that most ships have always been longer than they are wide, and most have a front end and a back.',
      'The engraved scene and its participants is very specific to the early nineteenth century, but an oar-driven boat much like that could have been pushing through the waves for many centuries before this, or possibly even for millennia. The two sailboats in the distance, however, have a much briefer heritage. Boats have had oars since the beginning, but sails on boats came much later, and have clearly changed and evolved. Initially, sails were used to journey only in the direction of the wind. The triangular shape of the sails in the engraving signifies that these ships were designed to sail partially into the direction of the wind. No ship can sail directly into the direction of the wind, but it is quite possible to sail at a certain small angle to the wind’s direction, then turn to sail at a small angle to the wind on the other side, and hence to zig-zag back and forth but progressing steadily in the direction the wind is coming from. This maneuver, called “tacking,” which is actually predicated on specific shapes and characteristics of the ship’s hull, in addition to the design of the sails and the rigging to hold them up, opened the great world oceans to human exploration.',
      'The next major development in coast-wise and maritime navigation is actually one of the most important developments on this subject in human history: Ship propulsion by non-human power. Until about the 1780s, all coast-wise and maritime navigation involved boats and ships like those in Plate One, propelled by human labor, and/or wind and currents. With the invention of steam engines, originally designed for very terrestrial work in mines and quarries, it soon became clear that propulsion of boats and ships by engines would transform travel over water. After many failed or unsatisfactory attempts, inventors on all sides of the Atlantic Ocean developed successful steam-powered craft in the 1780s. Steamboats began in coast-wise navigation, as the early ones weren’t capable of voyaging on the open ocean. Rapid improvements in all aspects of the ships’ design, as well as improvements in engines, soon changed this. The steamboat presented in Abraham Rees’s Cyclopaedia in 1819 was designed for use in relatively shallow and relatively calm water, as in a lake or on canals, or coastal waters, indicated by the flat keel and propulsion by paddle wheel, which limits contact with rocks and so on at depth, and the relatively wide deck. The craft appears to be a passenger-carrying vessel, with cabins with lots of windows and a fenced deck for sightseeing. Notice the hybrid nature of the vessel, combining the latest technology, a steam engine, with square sails for sailing with the wind, the very oldest type of sail. Below the boat are two different steam engine designs, both of which turn the energy released in steam into revolutions of a giant wheel, from which different applications can take off power for different purposes.',

      'The Travelers Pocket Map of Ohio with its canals, roads and distances, by stage & steam boat routes may seem anomalous in an essay on coast-wise and maritime navigation, but it is closely related to what came before, and reflects the fresh transformations in travel by boat and ship underway. All steam engines required fuel for their boilers and clean water for steam. The engines were made primarily of iron and steel, and slowly more and more ships were “iron-bottomed” too. Close available stocks of firewood and iron ore and coal were rapidly depleted, leading to a relentless search for these resources ever farther away. The “inland seas” of the Great Lakes, in particular, offered ships access to vast stores of metal ores, coal, chemicals and salts necessary to the Industrial Revolution. But there were choke-points on the waterways, particularly rapids and waterfalls, like Niagara Falls. The solution was to build canals around obstructions, and canals to supply more direct access to sources of bulk commodities, and link them to river transport, and ever larger steam ships on the Great Lakes. All these systems ultimately were connected to the maritime shipping systems previously developed. Hence it made perfect commercial sense for Edmund Blunt the Elder, the publisher of the American Coast Pilot and the New American Practical Navigator, to publish a guide to roads and canals in Ohio, and the shipping routes of bordering Lake Erie, and to do so in the form of a small, convenient pocket-sized volume.',

      'In 1807, Ferdinand Hassler (1770-1843), a Swiss immigrant scientist, successfully persuaded President Thomas Jefferson to use this technique for the American Survey of the Coast, authorized by Congress. The Survey’s early history was rocky and contentious, but by about 1834 Hassler’s system was deployed in force. Four years later, in 1838, the Coast Survey commissioned a commercial printer to produce the very first chart of the Survey of the Coast, New Haven Harbor. This harbor chart is very provisional compared to charts of a decade later, but Hassler’s methods are clearly displayed. Hassler pioneered working simultaneously on mapping the topography of the land, and the hydrography of the waters, tying them both together through the same sets of signal flags mounted along the shore. The spider webs of lines of number in the harbor are the lines of travel of the hydrographic boats, with the position of the numbers representing the horizontal positions of the boats, and the numbers themselves represent the depths of the water at precisely those spots. The marshes, woodlands, farmed fields and houses on the land were positioned by the same triangulation process as used for the hydrography, and topography and hydrography ultimately controlled horizontally by the master geodetic network Hassler established. There were two systems for vertical heights and depths, both based on the tidal systems of the harbor. The legend reports “the greatest tide observed in two Lunations,” or two complete lunar months, which gives some indication of the length of their fieldwork at the harbor. Heights on the land were based on a level of mean high tide, so that everything above that level was “land”, at least most of the time. The hydrographic depths were based on the level of mean low tide, so that depths mapped were at least that deep, most of the time. With a few changes and improvements, Hassler’s methodologies displayed in the New Haven harbor chart continued for most of the next century, until airplanes and aerial photography, and boats equipped with sonar depth finders changed nautical charting again.',

      'By the middle of the nineteenth century Western ships and their crews were sailing and steaming in all oceans and almost all coasts, except for the shores of Antarctica. Popular and scientific interest in these voyages was high, and a number of geographical societies and important geographic journals were established. In 1851, the American Geographical and Statistical Society was founded in New York City (“statistical” was later dropped from its title). In 1854, August Petermann founded Petermanns Geographische Mitteilungen, a journal of geography and cartography, in Gotha, Thuringia, in what later was to be central Germany. Petermann and his craftsmen were experts in lithography and especially chromo-lithography, the art of lithographing in co-registered color. Their skills quickly made Petermanns the premier geographic journal on the planet. An examination of a single annual volume for the year 1859 yields three maps that convey the frontiers of maritime navigation in that year, in multiple senses. The maps are stratified by the three bands of latitude they present: the tropics, the broad temperate zone, and the arctic.',
      'The tropical map presents a historic political and legal framework unfamiliar to most Americans: The great archipelago of islands constituting American Polynesia. The context is this: by the 1840s, American supplies of phosphate rock, a relatively scarce yet critical chemical material used in gunpowder and for fertilizer, were running out. Bird guano, deposited over eons on exposed rocks and islands in the oceans, became a substitute for mined deposits of phosphate rock. Many of these rocks and islands were located in extremely remote places, which is in part why they were favorable sites for nesting birds. In 1856, Congress passed the Guano Islands Act, which stated: “Whenever any citizen of the United States discovers a deposit of guano on any island, rock, or key, not within the lawful jurisdiction of any other Government, and not occupied by the citizens of any other Government, and takes peaceable possession thereof, and occupies the same, such island, rock, or key may, at the discretion of the President, be considered as appertaining to the United States.” Only three years later, many dozens of such rocks and islands and keys in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean had been claimed as territories of the United States, and hence a broad curvy line encircles a portion of the vast archipelago of islands and reefs straddling the Equator. Note that this 1859 conception of American Polynesia did not include American Samoa, which is a portion of the Samoa cluster of islands in the center of the map directly south of the boundary of American Polynesia. American claims to Samoa came later, between 1887-1889, in a great crisis between the United States, Imperial Germany, and Great Britain.',
      'In 1859, the United States and Great Britain were involved in contention and disputes over territorial claims in the great band of temperate latitudes, on the Pacific coast at the boundary zone between Washington Territory in the United States, and British Columbia in Canada, then still claimed by Great Britain as British territory. The terrestrial portion of the boundary between the nations was mutually agreed to be the 49th Parallel of latitude, but agreements dissolved at the Pacific water’s edge. Great Britain and the United States agreed that all of Vancouver Island was British, although it extended south of the 49th Parallel. But there are a myriad of islands in between Vancouver Island and the mainland of the continent: To whom would they belong? The Haro Archipelago, or San Juan Islands, was at stake. As the map in Petermanns clearly reveals, the rival national boundary claims are actually two major ship routes in between the Strait of Juan de Fuca on the south, and the Georgia Strait on the north. Hence, the national claims to territory on land were based on different pathways of ships in the water around the land. Eventually Great Britain acceded to the American claims, and the San Juan Islands are part of the state of Washington in the United States.',
      'Moving now to the Arctic, we can examine a map and another inset map defining one of the most celebrated tragedies of exploration in the nineteenth century. For centuries, European explorers had searched for a conjectured “Northwest Passage” which would lead from the western Atlantic Ocean further northwest to enter the Pacific Ocean, allowing travel by water at temperate latitudes, with minimal disruptions and hazards from ice. None of their explorations were successful, although in the effort they “discovered” major portions of what is now Canada, almost all of which had already been explored and settled by native Athebascan, Micmac, Algonquin, Iroquois, and Inuit and other peoples. Eventually, Sir John Barrow, who was Second Secretary of the British Admiralty from 1804 until 1845, proposed that Great Britain should search for a much more northerly Northwest Passage, which would link the more northern Atlantic Ocean to the Arctic Ocean, essentially going over the top of most of Canada. Eventually Barrow settled on Sir John Franklin to command the expedition to find the passage. Under him were the officers and men of two ships, HMS Terror and HMS Erebus, which had been built for duty exploring the fringes of Antarctica, and were well equipped for Arctic service. Each had a steam engine designed and built by British railroads, along with steam-heat for the crew, and ships’ libraries with more than a thousand books. They departed England in May, 1845. Apart from Franklin and the captain of the other ship, and an assistant surgeon and two ice-masters, none of the other 129 men had any experience at all in the Arctic. Off they steamed, and disappeared. After two years had passed, the British public, and also Lady Franklin, urged the Admiralty to send teams to search for the party and learn their fate. The search for the fate of Lord Franklin became one of the cultural touchstones of the era. Many expeditions were launched, and over time, clues were found. The 1859 Petermanns map indicates the major findings as of that date, although the “search for Lord Franklin” continued well into the twentieth century. The map on the left shows the known route of the expedition until it turned back south. The two dotted paths were the speculative routes necessary so that ships’ survivors could have arrived on the small islands in McClintock Sound where significant remains and clues were found. The map on the right, at a much larger scale, shows the final area and its context. It also demonstrates that waves of searchers managed to ignore native Inuit place names, if they even knew them in the first place, and instead they littered the landscape with their own names.',

      'Less than three decades after Franklin steamed off to his dreadful fate, another Arctic expedition disappeared into the white void for two years, but returned as a triumphant success. The differences between the two expeditions include better luck and better provisions, but also the changes underway in the very purposes and goals of exploration by ship in extreme Arctic and Antarctic environments. In 1872, the Austro-Hungarian North Pole Expedition, which was privately funded by several wealthy noble families in Austria-Hungary, steamed into the Arctic Ocean in summer aboard a small fleet of ships, the main one of which was the Tegetthoff, a three-masted schooner with a powerful steam engine. The two leaders, Captain Weyprecht and Julius von Payer, were skilled scientists, and the small crew included many specialists in meteorology, astronomy, geodesy, and terrestrial magnetism. The Tegetthoff sailed north, discovering the Franz Josef Archipelago of Arctic islands before the ship was caught in pack ice. For almost two years, the ship was stuck in the ice, although the pack ice moved, as they were able to measure by determining their positions astronomically. In May, 1874, the party determined to abandon the ice-locked ship and return south over the ice, with sledges carrying small boats to be used once they reached the margins of the ice pack. They actually accomplished this, and on August 14, 1874, they reached the open ocean. On September 3, they reached the Russian mainland, having sailed and rowed across more than a hundred miles of the open Arctic Ocean. They returned to Vienna, the capital of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, as heroes. Members of the expedition published many reports on various scientific observations from the voyage, and their productivity was a spur towards the creation of a great collaborative scientific project, the International Polar Year, in 1882-83. The voyage of the Tegetthoff was in many ways the beginnings of modern polar science.',

      'A related application of maritime navigation to the earth sciences can be seen in Otto Krümmel’s pioneering map of the Sargasso Sea, at the center of the North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre, published in Petermanns in 1891. The Sargasso Sea is named for Sargassum, a genus of brown algae, and especially Sargassum bacciferum, which grows in abundance in the lens of warm water pushed in on top of permanently colder water below by the actions of the subtropical gyre which surrounds the Sea. A look back at Bowditch and Blunt’s 1807 chart showing “The Trade Wind” compared to Krümmel’s map, shows the relationship between an arm of the gyre and the Sargasso Sea. The dense Sargassum drifts in the Sargasso Sea serve as nurseries for the larvae of both American and European eel species, and as protective habitat for young endangered loggerhead sea turtles, as well as many other sea creatures. On the map, the dark cross-hatched strands which are largely vertical or horizontal represent the mappings that the great German scientist Alexander von Humboldt made of what he called “Fucusbänke”, the long windrow-like concentrations of Sargassum as he found them. Krümmel, by contrast, mapped his own perceptions of the distribution of Sargassum in tints of vivid green “by the aid of steam”, as the Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society reported on Krümmel’s 1891 publication in Petermanns. By this, they refer to Krümmel’s main data source, which were the logs of many German steam ships that recorded the presence and densities of Sargassum as they steamed across the Atlantic.

      'The US Coast Survey began working cooperatively with the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1871, long before the “annexation” of the Kingdom into the United States. But the Survey’s mandate included mapping the territorial waters of the nation, so from about 1900 on, first the Survey, and now NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, has produced nautical charts of the Hawaiian Island, which is really a great arced archipelago of volcanic islands and fringing coral reefs. The 1934 version of the Survey’s chart displays many features of the profound changes in mapping and navigational technologies that were introduced in the early twentieth century. Following the disaster of the sinking of the Titanic in 1912, Reginald Fessenden and other scientists at the Submarine Signal Company explored using pulses of underwater sound to reflect off icebergs and return to the transmitting ship, thereby providing warnings of an iceberg ahead. They discovered, though, that the sound would also reflect off the ocean bottom and return to the transmitting ship. Given accurate knowledge of the speed of sound transmission through sea water, which is itself a complex subject, they realized it would be possible to estimate the depth of the water to the bottom below. After the Second World War and further underwater acoustics research, Herbert Dorsey invented the fathometer, the first precise depth finding device. Dorsey joined the Survey, and by the late 1920s, the Survey was using fathometers to measure deep water depths rapidly and accurately, thereby completely eliminating the need for stopping a Survey ship for lead line soundings of the bottom. The fathometers worked as the ship steamed ahead. The pronounced patterning of lines of numbers on the Hawaiian nautical chart represents the very tracks followed by the Survey ships as they steamed in uniform configurations around the main set of islands, or steamed toward and back from isolated islands, such as Palmyra Island, south of the main set of Hawaiian Islands, and visible in the 1859 map that appeared in Petermanns. Palmyra Island is in fact one the islands originally claimed as US territory by the Guano Islands Act! There was, in fact, no guano on Palmyra island, and in 1862 it was formally annexed to the Kingdom of Hawaii under King Kamehameha IV, and later transferred to the United States as part of the annexation of Hawaii. Note as well the influence of radio on the Hawaiian chart. The chart shows two radio beacon stations, represented by red circles, one on Kauai and one on Oahu. Ships and planes with directional radio equipment could “fly the beam” broadcast by the radio beacon to determine their positions relative to the stations from far out of sight of the islands.',

      'One of the earliest canal maps published in the United States was a simple route map connecting two of the most important seaports of the new nation by way of inland navigation. But it was not intended to present a particular route or advance a specific proposal. Instead, it illustrated one practical application of a new, revolutionary method for developing canals in the United States. At the time, the nation was struggling to develop a transportation system in order to advance its economy with very limited sources of capital. In the midst of the Napoleonic Wars, it was also facing difficulties raising funds abroad. The Embargo Act was, in effect, forcing the US to rely on its own resources.',
      'Christopher Colles, an engineer by profession, advanced a novel idea that would take advantage of the abundant forests that covered America from the Atlantic Coast to the Mississippi Valley. His plan is discussed in the next essay on canal maps but can be simply put: Use timber to build elevated canals and save the expense of digging; then sell the land along the waterway to finance the project. Thus to fully understand this map one needs to view its accompanying drawings, in this case a cross-section of the elevated canal and a plat of the lots to be sold along the right-of-way. One additional map-reading aid, placed at the end of the twenty-two-page pamphlet, charts the “Comparative Expense of Navigable Canals in England and America.” Therefore the map provides a fundamental example of the nature of canal cartography: a reader usually needs assistance provided by additional maps, drawings, charts, or tables, as well as a text, to fully understand the sheet at hand.',
      'But a question remains about this pioneer American map of inland navigation: Why did Colles select a New Jersey route for his example? Why did he not propose an early version of the Erie Canal instead? The simple answer was the economy. Colles was the first person to make a formal proposal for a canal connecting the Hudson River with the Great Lakes. Twenty-four years earlier, in 1784, Colles had sent a memorial to the New York legislature urging them to improve the navigation of the Mohawk River and then connect its headwaters at Wood Creek with Lake Ontario. The legislature did not want to get involved with the project and suggested that private enterprise do the job. The state did, however, provide funds for Colles to elaborate his proposal and “exhibit a plan thereof to the legislature at their next meeting,” meanwhile securing investors for the project. The drawings, if there were any, have not come to light, but Colles did elaborate his ideas in a pamphlet with an interesting title: Proposals for the Speedy Settlement of the Waste and Unappropriated Lands on the Western Frontier (New York: Samuel Louden, 1785). The next year a committee of the legislature invited Colles to continue his work, but apparently investors could not be secured for this “wilderness” improvement. The idea was abandoned and passed into obscurity, not to be recalled until the “Wedding of the Waters” ceremony at the completion of the Erie Canal thirty years later. (See David Hosack, Memoir of DeWitt Clinton).',
      'Even before this project came to naught, Colles had suggested a system for supplying good water to the city of New York, but without success. Then came the failure of his wilderness canal idea. It was followed by the nation’s first road atlas in 1789-1792, a celebrated historical document but a financial failure. As one contemporary put it, Colles “was a man of good character, an ingenious mechanician” but “considered a visionary projector, and his plans were sometimes treated with ridicule, and frequently viewed with distrust” (Hosack, 281).',
      'To limit any negative impressions in his 1808 publication, Colles illustrated his idea for wooden above-ground waterways with an example connecting the nation’s two largest cities, a route that would eventually be taken by several profitable canals largely devoted to supplying New York City with anthracite coal. Note on the map how the proposed route cuts across New Jersey near the headwaters of various streams, answering possible questions about an adequate water supply. This route may also have been an appeal for support from a particular group of investors who were then interested in exploiting iron ore deposits across New Jersey, a factor that was important in the early success of the Morris Canal constructed later in the northern part of the state. The route on the Colles map was never developed, although the Delaware and Raritan Canal (proposed in 1816, completed in 1834) roughly followed the road eastward from Trenton, through Princeton, to reach the Raritan River that flowed to Amboy across from the western tip of Staten Island.',
      'Note several details on the map. First, how Colles’s proposal ends near Middletown on the Atlantic Ocean, suggesting the need for the transfer of cargo and passengers to oceangoing vessels to reach New York City. Also, the engineer emphasized the boundary between East and West New Jersey because of land rights and property titles. Finally, note the major road running through Spotswood that appears on the map, suggesting an alternative route to Manhattan.',

      'Zadok Cramer, a native of New Jersey, at “a very early age” crossed the Alleghany Mountains, perhaps by way of the Potomac River, and took up an apprenticeship in printing and bookbinding at Washington, Pennsylvania. Upon completion of his responsibilities, the young man moved to Pittsburgh to practice his trade. Soon after he arrived, John Gilkison, who was setting up the first bookstore in the Western parts of the country, passed away. The young Cramer became the logical person to take over this business in 1800, and he soon gathered together several publishing ideas and, apparently as soon as he was able, acquired a printing press to print schoolbooks and other useful titles for the Ohio Valley. One of the projects that he initiated, or took over from another hand, was a set of directions for merchants descending the Ohio River and selling their goods from settlement to settlement along the way. These notes also proved valuable to pioneers who used flatboats to move their families and possessions downstream to set up farms and towns in the Ohio Valley. Thus, when the “third corrected edition” of this work appeared in 1802, under Cramer’ imprint, it was entitled The Ohio and Mississippi Navigator, “printed by John Scull for Zadok Cramer, bookseller and stationer.”',
      'The title described the contents, first as “an ample account of those beautiful rivers” from the head of the Ohio to the mouth of the Mississippi. Next, the page indicated that the work provided descriptions of the “towns, posts, caves, ports, and harbors, etc. on their banks” and also “how to navigate them” with notes on “rocks, riffles, shoals, channels and the distances from place to place.” The contents were “first taken from the Journals of Gentlemen of observation, and now minutely corrected by several persons who have navigated those rivers for fifteen and twenty years.”',
      'No copies of the first and second editions of The Navigator are known to have survived. These most probably were not issued by Cramer and may well have carried different titles emphasizing commerce rather than navigation. There are some hints that the original version may reach back to the 1790s under the heading of “The Trader’s Useful Guide.” Moreover, Anthony Páez Mullan of the Library of Congress has located a manuscript version in French, apparently dated 1804 and probably based on the 1802 version, which could raise additional possibilities when it is thoroughly studied.',
      'At any rate, Cramer’s The Navigator soon became the standard navigational aid for the Western waters. By 1806 Cramer was printing his own copies, constantly enlarging the publication. In 1805 he enhanced the text with fourteen maps showing Pittsburgh and the Mississippi River. The next year he expanded cartographic coverage to show both rivers, the Ohio and the Mississippi, from the source of the former to the mouth of the latter. “We flatter ourselves with the hope that they will be found as useful to the navigator as they have been troublesome to us.” (Sixth ed., 1808, 4) This edition of the book, now at 156 pages, also included a short account of the Missouri and Columbia rivers as traversed by captains Lewis and Clark. The seventh version of the book, issued in 1811, expanded to 295 pages. It used the extra space to elaborate its commentaries on the cities and towns along the rivers. Cramer’s health was failing at this point so the volume was published with a partner.',
      'Times were changing on the rivers as well. In 1811, as Nicholas Roosevelt’s steamboat departed from Pittsburgh, Cramer hailed a new era on the Western waters: “Now the white sail of commerce is to give place to vessels propelled by steam.” By the time the next version of The Navigator appeared, Cramer had died just short of his fortieth year of life.',
      'His book and his maps, however, continued to live on, with at least four more editions appearing under Cramer’s name before 1824. Then other titles with a similar format took over the market. The most successful of these, The Western Pilot, by Samuel Cummings, continued to be published until 1854. Steamboats actually increased the demand for river maps and charts, and in some ways they also stimulated flatboat traffic downstream by affording a convenient way of return upstream. Thus the crude map pictured here tells many stories, not the least of which is a fundamental point about the history of travel maps in general. They usually started as written itineraries to which maps were later added. Then the text often departed to appear in separate book form and more elaborate maps stood on their own.',
      'Separate maps of American rivers were beginning to appear in 1821 when the firm of Cramer & Spear published the eleventh edition of The Navigator, largely a reprint in smaller type of the 1814 version. For example, the steamboat firm of Goodrich & Company produced a strip map of the Hudson River 102 inches long in 1820. But the crude woodcut of the Ohio River at the rapids near Louisville, shown here, had a life that reached back to 1808 and extended, in a similar format, up to 1854. In a simple way, it showed a navigator where he was on the river, but he needed the text, and perhaps the services of a pilot, for a successful passage. The Louisville and Portland Canal around the “Falls of the Ohio” was not completed until 1831 and was often more serviceable to steamboats than to the smaller and cruder boats used by the common folk. Note also how this 1821 map was outdated at the time of its printing: Indiana had already been a state for five years.',
      'Readers may wish to compare Cramer’s crude map of the Ohio rapids with those drawn by Thomas Hutchins in his A Topographical Description of Virginia, Pennsylvania, Maryland and North Carolina (London, 1778) and the one by Jared Brooks, drawn in 1807 and reprinted in 1834.',

      'Joseph Louis Etienne Cordier, a young French engineer who did outstanding work on two of Napoleon’s transportation projects, one a highway and the other a canal, soon headed the northern department of the French corps of engineers. He spent his entire career pushing a variety of projects to completion, including over twenty canals, river improvements, and harbors. To stimulate public support for these projects, and to buttress a master plan for the development of canals and waterways in France, Cordier translated from English into French the 1803 edition of John Phillips’s classic A General History of Inland Navigation. The volume appeared in Paris in 1819, packed with many diversions sounding Cordier’s favorite themes.',
      'At the time of its publication, Albert Gallatin, the US Minister to France, informed the French engineer about his own interest in internal improvements, including his important “Report on Roads and Canals” presented to Congress in 1808 when he was Secretary of the Treasury. When FranVois Becquey, Cordier’s superior, issued his influential Report to the King in 1820, it bore some striking resemblances to the Gallatin Report made a dozen years earlier in America. By then Cordier had compiled a second volume of his translations of important canal documents from English into French, featuring Gallatin’s 1808 report and including documents related to the Grand Canal in New York. The sheer size of the Erie Canal, 350 miles in length, plus its enormous cost, staggered the Frenchman’s imagination. His book needed a map of that magnificent undertaking to underscore his major point: France needed a system of waterways and the Americans had shown the way.',
      'It was reported that Cordier completed his second volume in 1819 but a printing issue delayed its appearance until the following year. Perhaps the maps caused the delay. The earliest printed maps of the Erie Canal appeared in the Western Canal Commission Report in 1817. Copies must have soon crossed the ocean, perhaps addressed to Albert Gallatin, and arrived in Paris in time for Cordier to have them adapted for a French audience and attached to his waiting second volume.',
      'The Canal Commissioners would not issue “A New Map and Profile of the Proposed Canal from Lake Erie to the Hudson River” until 1821.  And, to my knowledge, a set of maps equivalent to the three published in Paris would not appear until 1825. These were featured in Cadwallader D. Colden’s memorial volume for the “Wedding of the Waters” ceremony in New York Harbor on October 26, 1825.',
      'Cordier’s set of maps carries the title “Carte du Nord Des États Unis et ou Grand Canal de Communication….” It is made up of three separate parts. The major map shows the route of the canal between Lake Erie and the Hudson River, but its regional context extends from Montreal to Lake Michigan and south to Washington, DC and the mouth of the Ohio River. The second element in the set of maps is a profile or “Nivellement” of the Grand Canal. It is somewhat sketchy to be sure and does not indicate the locks that would connect one pool of water with the next.  Instead the chart shows the elevation for each pool of water.  This information is then repeated in outline form on the “Plan et Profil du Canal…”, printed on a separate sheet, on which the waterway route is directly related to a profile by a series of vertical lines. On this sheet the place names are not translated into French, but apparently follow information supplied by the Canal Commissioners.',
      'Given the early date of the French map, much of the data is very tentative, and many aspects of the plan had to be changed, especially in the western reaches of the canal. But as it stands, Cordier’s set of maps, appearing at such an early date, in Paris no less, points to the international importance of the Erie Canal and its monumental role in the global story of public works.',

      'This magnificent wall map, nearly four feet high and over five feet wide, is probably the most important canal map ever published in the United States. It appeared four years after the completion of the Erie Canal and just before the first railroads in the nation, short lines in the three separate locations, started operations. Railroads are, of course, included in the title of this map as proposed internal improvements, but they were considered at the time to be handmaidens to waterborne traffic, feeders and connectors used to unite canals and waterways into “one great system.”  The proposed Great Western Railway, under horsepower, would connect the canals [existing and proposed] of five states between a point on the Hudson River, near New York City, “accessible at all seasons to steam ferry-boats” to “the head of steam-boat navigation on the Illinois River,” a point near Chicago, a future city which a canal commission would soon call into existence. One needed, it seems, a big map for big ideas.',
      'Tanner’s great work could be considered a canal map because the ten canal profiles which surround the main presentation serve as buttresses, shoring up national unity and economic prosperity, completing nature’s plan by tying the nation together with ribbons of water. Tanner’s wall map, in the nature of waterways cartography, brings together dozens of images and is set in a whole complex of publications, including his New American Atlas, which dated back to 1819 and was continuously published in may editions up to 1839. This atlas furnished maps and a format for at least four other atlases issued by Tanner during this period including A New College Atlas. Moreover, it was Tanner’s habit to preface his early atlases with “geographical memoirs,” a practice he continued by writing a 108-page Memoir of the Recent Surveys, Observations, and Internal Improvements…Intended to Accompany His New Map of the United States (1829). “The profiles or vertical sections constitute one of the most valuable and interesting features of the maps,” he wrote, providing elevations above sea level for “upwards of six hundred points in various parts of the United States.” Such information was “almost indispensable to a clear understanding of matters connected with the great work of internal improvement of our country, which is everywhere in active progress.” (106 and 107)',
      'In other words, put the map on the wall, study it with care, note how the various parts of the map support each other, and then listen to hear the trumpets announcing the march of progress in the Canal Era. Tanner’s Memoir described how he sent a circular letter to knowledgeable people throughout the nation requesting information on a variety of topics to include on his map. This “fresh information,” as he called it, often included manuscript maps of localities which had previously been “imperfectly represented on the existing maps.” This data also helped Tanner fill the spaces on the sheet “which would otherwise have been left blank,” including city plans, inset maps of metropolitan regions, charts, tables, and profiles of canals and railroads. All in all, fifteen hundred new names appeared on the map along with 22,000 miles of new roads plus 4057 miles of canals and railroads, “the greater part of which has never been traced on a map of the United States.” (104)',
      'The arteries of transportation were the sinews that bound the nation together, encouraging commercial exchange, the movement of people, and the exchange of ideas. But the profiles or vertical sections constituted one of the map’s most valuable features. Most used the same horizontal scale as the main map, 30 miles to the inch, and employed a common vertical scale of 1000 feet per inch. Thus the map reader could use the profiles as keys to understanding the topography of the country, a critical key to understanding a transportation system built on canals and the navigation of inland waterways. The “general diffusion” of this topographical knowledge would, Tanner believed, help citizens not only envision the great opportunities set before them, but would also “serve to check those impractical and frivolous projects which interested speculators are constantly urging on the unwary.” (107)',
      'A final feature of the map, a source of great pride to the publisher, was that all of the leading roads and most of those secondary in nature were marked with the distances between towns. This was true on the insets as well as the main map. A reader needed to work at it to get a sense of the physical nature of the country, but a traveller could tell at a glance how far it was from a present location to points beyond in every direction.',

      'The Hudson River provided a long reach into North America for ocean-going ships from the dawn of European exploration until the early nineteenth century. It was no accident that the advent of steam navigation should take place on Henry Hudson’s river or that Robert Fulton, having turned his interest from canal engineering to steamboats, should be the creative genius who demonstrated how steam could power commercial vessels. It soon became possible for steamboats to follow regular schedules up and down the Hudson River. Shortly thereafter, people wanted guidebooks to help them appreciate the passing scenery, turning passengers into tourists. The completion of the Erie and Champlain canals in 1825 accelerated this trend, and the subsequent development of railroads in the 1830s and 1840s extended the new tourist industry into the America interior. Pratt’s River and Railroad Guide documents this situation in 1848, the very year that the opening of the Illinois and Michigan Canal completed the promise of the canal age and hinted, at the same time, that railroad tracks would soon command over the nation’s transportation system.',
      'Pratt’s Guide extended its coverage beyond the Hudson River and the Erie Canal to provide maps of the Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, and Illinois Rivers in addition to the Hudson. Railroads had by then grown in importance so that they received equal billing in the title of Pratt’s book, but they still were called “connecting lines” between waterways, which took the major responsibility for enabling a traveler to go from Boston to New Orleans, the publisher’s way of indicating on the title page that his guide was national in scope.',
      'Actually, the Hudson River maps for the booklet were adapted from an 1846 broadside map and guide to the river that “may be had at the Bar of the Steam-Boat Troy.” This earlier sheet featured a map of the Hudson at the center of a three-column format, with schedules and a guide to cities and towns on the outer two columns. Pratt simply cut the strip map of the Hudson into sections, updated it, and then developed similar maps for his other key routes.',
      'The map focuses our attention on the great river, marking its flow down the center of the image, with a bold stroke. The stream’s major tributary, the Mohawk River, received a bold line as well, but it remained nameless on the page because it had been supplanted as a transportation artery by the Erie Canal and two railroads. The competition between the two railroads suggests an urban rivalry indicated in their names. Both lines cut the travel time on the Erie Canal by avoiding the long delay caused by the series of locks at the eastern end of the waterway. Note that one railroad headed toward Troy and the other connected Schenectady with Albany. In the competition between the two Hudson River ports, Albany soon won the battle due to its better rail connections and navigation facilities. (See Focus Map 6)',
      'Focus Map 5 is from the first edition of Pratt’s Guide, which was expected to be revised and enlarged each year with a new edition appearing every January 1st. The next issue, in 1849, for example, would include the 463-mile New York and Erie Railroad “with a description of every place on the entire route.” Advertising would hold down the price of the expanded Guide. In 1848, about sixty firms from New York and sixteen from Philadelphia ran advertisements placed throughout the booklet.',
      'The first content page of this practical publication was a chart giving the most expensive fares between cities, starting with the route between New Orleans and Boston via Chicago and Detroit in sixteen days at the first-class rate of $58. But, the table notes “that those who travel in the second train, or on deck of the steamers, and second class boats, etc. could go for much less expense.” (3) The Guide then provided brief paragraphs on the leading towns along each route, followed by a series of maps similar to the one shown here but at a much smaller scale. The first five maps, for example, cover the Mississippi River from Lake Pepin to New Orleans. The Erie Canal takes up three maps on pages 46 to 48, while the Hudson River needed six pages. Detailed distance charts cover all the major rivers, with 34 landings given for the route by steamboat on the Missouri River between Council Bluffs and St. Louis.',

      'Maps of rivers are often similar to canal maps because it takes more than one perspective to complete a picture of the waters. In this case the increasing size and burden of the steamboats ascending the river to connect with the Erie Canal traffic at Albany made the shallow, fluctuating channel of the river alongside Papscanee and Schodac islands a threat to navigation. S. H. Sweet, on the staff of the New York State Engineer and Surveyor, prepared this plan “for permanently improving the navigation” along this stretch of the waterway.',
      'Specifically, the proposal called for building dams and jetties at the water’s edge to channel the flow into the main stream in times of low water. To make his point, Sweet provided several section views of the proposed works, portraying both the high and low waterlines of the Hudson, plus the contours of the streambed into which piles would be driven to anchor the river’s improvements. Note that the jetties would not impede the current at high water but would take effect when the water level dropped to low levels.',
      'As Henry S. Tanner emphasized in his Memoir of the Recent Survey…(1829) (See Focus Map 4), the alert map reader interested in inland navigation must always keep the elevation of the land (and the depth of the water) in mind when looking at a map. Here the profiles suggest the general idea while the pattern of soundings made four years earlier traces the mean depth of the Hudson in systemic fashion across the riverbed. Meanwhile, hachured drawings of the hills along the littoral suggest that the land rises quickly along the banks, restricting the water’s overflow. Exceptions to this pattern are the low, marshy core of Papscanee Island, the shallows along Western Creek, and the low water upstream north of Shad Island. Dams to be placed in these areas would keep the midstream waters flowing at all times.',
      'Note how Sweet has also provided additional information on the map, including “McAlpines Proposed Ship Canal and Basin” to fill in the river immediately south of Albany and east of the Albany Turnpike. The original Erie Canal Basin was located to the north on the other side of the city. Meanwhile, auxiliary facilities would soon be provided in the Albany Basin, a facility similar to the one proposed here, but located upstream along the heart of the city. Additional harbor works also occupied the east bank and Van Rensselaer Island where tracks from New England railroads met canal barges and Hudson River steamboats.',

      'This map accompanied a “Memoranda on the Assistance which can be rendered to the Province of Canada by Her Majesty’s Navy in the Event of War with the United States.” Apparently compiled by Capt. Richard Collinson in September 1861, the nine-page pamphlet was printed in London in 1862. Although much of the publication was devoted to statistical information, several points are made in the text that would help readers to understand the map.',
      'In the first place, in the event of a war with Union forces in the United States and Canada, vessels of the largest size could proceed from the Atlantic Ocean to Quebec at the upper right-hand corner of the map. Vessels drawing less than eighteen feet of water could then continue on to Montreal, but the lock at the LaChine Canal above that city would limit navigation beyond that point to smaller vessels. Thus the passageway between the United States and Canada along the River Richelieu, where three railroads from Portland, Boston, and New York converge, “will probably be the scene of severe struggle.”',
      'The second conclusion stated that because the St. Lawrence River serves as a boundary line between the two countries, the navigable channel would be under fire from opposing shores for a hundred miles. Sackett’s Harbor at the eastern end of Lake Ontario, the former Naval Arsenal of the United States, was no longer fortified and would be of little concern in the event of war. Instead, “the main object of the enemy will no doubt be the possession of the Welland Canal” (2) which accommodated ships with a ten-foot draft. An alternative route from the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes, safe from canons based on US soil, was the Ottawa River- Riedau Canal route, but it was only six feet deep. This alternate route is better portrayed on Focus Map 8, published in the same year, but with the economy as its theme, not military affairs. Collinson thus concluded that it would be almost impossible during wartime for any British vessel to reach Lake Huron from the sea. As a result it was “of great importance that there should be a [British] squadron upon it.” (3)',
      'A third point, on the deployment of this force, focused on the occupation of Michillimackinac Island which would “close communication between Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. This stroke would “in a great measure render abortive the great naval superiority on the lakes which is at present possessed by the United States.” (3) This “great naval superiority” is spelled out in a table on page 4. The US had 248 steamboats and 958 sailing vessels totaling 319,469 tons compared with 82 and 247 comparable Canadian vessels totaling 70,734 tons.',
      'Beyond concerns about naval affairs on the Great Lakes, this memorandum also included statistics on the canals in Canada and in those states of the Union bordering on the Great Lakes. These facilities would be important in the movement of supplies and the passage of ships in the event of war. The chart, for example, noted that the Erie Canal could only pass boats of 80 tons burden but the Illinois and Michigan Canal could accommodate boats of almost twice that size, 150 tons. Thus some of the Union gunboats used on the Mississippi River would probably be of greater concern to the British than similar military craft using the Hudson River.',

      'The office of the State Engineer and Surveyor needed a convenient sheet to portray the entire inland navigation system of New York State. This map would be especially useful to include in reports the agency was required to make to the legislature. S.H. Sweet, the engineer responsible for the proposed navigation improvements on the Hudson River in 1856, (see Focus Map 6) had been promoted to Deputy State Engineer and Surveyor in 1862 when this map was published as part of the office’s annual report. The profile and map appeared in this format for many years, the plates being updated and the data augmented according to each year’s activities.',
      'In essence, the sheet was composed of two basic elements: first, profiles of the canal system with its various branches, but these are laid out like a map to create a schematic diagram of the whole system. Because it followed consistent scales, both vertically and horizontally, the profile of the system encroached on the sheet’s second element, a traditional “Map of the State of New York Showing Canals and Railroads.” Note how its coverage extended beyond the state’s boundaries to include adjacent states and their railroads and canals. Thus, the map pointed to the centrality of the Erie Canal in powering the economy of the region. This economic message extended to Canada as well, the map extending across the international border to include the River Richelieu Corridor, north of Lake Champlain, where a great battle was expected to take place if war were to break out between the United States and Great Britain. (Focus Map 7)',
      'But Sweet’s map is silent on military matters. Sackett’s Harbor, the large US Naval Base at the western end of Lake Ontario, is not mentioned because at the time, it was largely abandoned. The map, however, includes significant economic locations such as the Anthracite Coal Region in Pennsylvania that brought great profits to the Delaware and Hudson Canal. Also, note how the map underscores major transportation corridors such as the Hudson River with railroads running along each side and then continuing northward with the Champlain Canal, to the lake itself and the River Richelieu beyond, all the way to the St. Lawrence River.',
      'The canal profiles, on the other hand, are engineering documents richly supplied with elevation data and complete coverage on the feeders and their sources to maintain the levels of the various pools created by the canal, as well as jurisdictional information showing the boundaries of each division and section into which the waterway was divided. Note that some feeders, like Glen Falls, also used locks and dams.',
      'One of the interesting transportation features on the map is the Erie Railroad, not identified but following a northwesterly route from New York City to Binghampton and then cutting across New York State by way of its southern counties to reach Dunkirk on Lake Erie. While the Erie Canal was under construction, political forces from these southern counties pushed the state to sponsor a survey for a southern New York Canal along this route, but the report was unfavorable due to the topography, and the surveyors recommended a railroad instead.',

    content: [
      'This map tells one chapter in a story that reaches back to 1785 and extends at least to 1880, almost a century of internal improvements. The idea of linking the James River, a major stream on Virginia’s Atlantic Slope, with the headwaters of the Ohio River Basin on the other side of the Appalachian Mountains, reaches back to colonial days. The Erie Canal would, of course, achieve this objective in 1825, but it would reach the basin of the Great Lakes rather than the Ohio River Valley. The Potomac River, which formed part of Virginia’s northern boundary, presented a direct, central route for a canal across the mountains and the Potomac Company, organized in 1785, eventually reached inland to Cumberland, Maryland, in 1842. But, here progress halted, and the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, although meeting some degree of success, remained a regional canal, never reaching the Ohio Valley.',
      'The James River project, from the very beginning paired with the Potomac effort for political reasons, also garnered success by improving navigation to Richmond where it built a splendid harbor. Efforts to push this success upstream and cross the summit to tap the resources of the Ohio Valley, however, were hampered by a lack of financial resources. Progress might have sped up in 1859 when a French Company wanted to purchase the existing facilities and extend the canal to the Ohio River, but the Civil War destroyed these prospects and the valuable assets such as the Richmond docks as well. Moreover, the company’s properties in West Virginia were confiscated when the area achieved statehood in 1862. After the war, with the company at the ebb of its fortunes, it decided to make a desperate push for new funding, hopefully from the federal government. A publicity campaign launched by the company included the publication of maps and pamphlets underscoring the advantages of the James-Kanawha-Ohio Rivers route.',
      'This map appeared in one of those publications, The Central Water-Line from the Ohio River to the Virginia Capes…Affording the Shortest Outlet of Navigation from the Mississippi Basin to the Atlantic (Richmond, 1868). Edward Lorraine, the company’s chief engineer, proposed a canal for steamboats only 227 miles long to make the connection. The Erie Canal, by comparison, was 363 miles long. The Great Central Water Line would be cheaper than the railroads, central to the nation, and following a route that would be open all year.',
      'Matthew Fontaine Maury, the celebrated scientist, added his talents to the campaign when he joined the faculty of the Virginia Military Institute in 1868. As the Superintendent of the Physical Survey of Virginia, Maury apparently utilized many of the arguments, data, and proposals generated by the canal company and enunciated by its chief engineer. The Central Water Line idea, in Maury’s hands, became a transcontinental, even global idea, finding expression in the paragon of American waterways cartography. Focus Map 10 should be placed into the context of Maury’s classic map, “Steam Line between Norfolk & Flushing” which first appeared in the Physical Survey of Virginia (1868). The synergy which seems plainly evident between the canal company’s Great Central Water Line idea and Maury’s broad vision manifested itself in the company’s reprinting of the Physical Survey maps and the many parallels between passages in their respective publications.',
      'The campaign for the Central Water Line attracted support in national discussion, local politics, and Congressional actions. The General Assembly of Iowa, for instance, angry with the Chicago railroads, appealed to Congress on the canal’s behalf. Similar resolutions came from Ohio and Kansas. In 1872 Congress started to move, appropriating funds for a detailed survey. A Senate Committee kept interest alive, but the long depression of the 1870s and a devastating flood on the James River in 1878 put the matter out of hand. A railroad crossed the summit and funds, from both government and private sources, concentrated on improving navigation on the Kanawha River. Using French-inspired movable dams, the hundred-mile section of the Great Kanawha below the falls became “the first controlled-waterway navigation in American,” completed in 1891. But a water connection to the James River was never built.',

      'Railroads were the big winners in competition with waterways as a result of the Civil War. Their military service in moving troops, munitions, and supplies demonstrated their essential function in economic development. Roads, canals, and steamboat navigation remained important, but with the Republican Party in control, economic development, Westward expansion, and technological innovation were given high priority. The Transcontinental Railroad, approved by the wartime Congress and supported by presidential leadership, functioned as the centerpiece of the nation’s transportation boom in the post-war decade.',
      'A major issue, however, pitting interior navigation interests against railroad interests, involved the bridging of rivers by railroad companies. Abraham Lincoln himself, as a railroad lawyer, had successfully argued a case for the railroad when a steamboat struck the first railroad bridge across the Mississippi River at Rock Island. To provide an engineering context for additional bridges across the Great River, Congress in 1866 appropriated funds for a survey of the Upper Mississippi River, requesting information on “plans of construction as will offer the least impediment to the navigation of the river.” Field work, directed by the celebrated General Gouverneur K. Warren, took up the first two years, but a final report was delayed until 1878 for a variety of reasons. The document, a 232-page book with sixty-one fold-out maps, graphs, and charts probably had limited utility as new bridge technologies reduced the value of the work. By the publication date, eleven bridges had already crossed the river, while others were authorized or under construction.',
      'A set of interesting maps or sections in the report portrayed the bluffs on both sides of the river, showing their generalized geology and exaggerated topography. These drawings, with the left bank at the top and the right bank at the bottom, traced the course of the Mississippi from Fort Snelling near St. Paul at the top to the Jefferson Barracks just south of St. Louis. Note that this is really a strip map in two parts, with the top set of profiles documenting the northern portion of the valley and the bottom set continuing the coverage from just south of the mouth of the Rock River in Illinois to a point immediately south of the mouth of the Missouri River.',
      'In places the profile of the bluffs is not given either because these hills were composed of glacial till and not solid rock or because the flood plain reached far back from the water’s edge. In general, however, the profiles show how deeply the tributary streams, even small creeks, have cut their way through the bedrock so that their mouths equal the elevation of the Great River. A reader needs a map of the river to set these profiles into their proper context. Then one could, with some effort, piece together both the overhead perspective provided by the map and the profile view from the water’s surface. It would then be apparent that Sabula, Iowa, Sheet 2, at the top left, is a town on a low-lying island with towering palisades surrounding it.',

The other panels provided information about the White Mountain resort area and the railroad service. Two views are included, one showing Mt. Washington from the “Turnpike near Fabyanʼs.” The caption then hastens to add “Seen also from P.&O.R.R.” The whole point of the map on the verso documents this addendum, pointing out how the tracks penetrate the mountains, proceeding all the way through the Notch, offering “delightful scenery” as well as ready access to the resorts. The tourist, the leaflet points out, as “the Mountains close in before him...[will be] brought face to face with all their changing form and rugged outlines.”',

The base map was produced by the railroad on the occasion, in that very year, 1885, of its completion across the continent.

The map therefore presents a triumph in both engineering and nationalism. The last spike was driven on November 7, 1885 and shortly thereafter a military train traversed the entire route, leaving Halifax and arriving in Vancouver before the line was shut down in the Rockies by the severe winter. Even earlier in the year the uncompleted tracks had moved troops and supplies from eastern installations to the Saskatchewan district where Metis and Native American groups resisted the push toward a unified nation.',

Ralphʼs basic message was that people would be energized by a change of scenery every so often and they especially needed contact with nature to stay in good health. A trip by rail along the south shore of Lake Superior would not only fit the bill, but would also offer a convenient short cut for a transcontinental journey because the Duluth, South-Shore, & Atlantic tracks connected with the Canadian Pacific Railway eastward to Montreal and with the Northern Pacific westward to Seattle and Tacoma.',
      'The Duluth, South-Shore, & Atlantic Railway was a new company, assembled in 1887 from several short lines, each mostly carrying ore and logs to lake ports. It would not have its own route all the way along Lake Superior until 1892, previously using a Northern Pacific route at its western reach. Although the Passenger Department made a valiant effort to secure customers, this service was never successful. A second version of the book and map came out in 1891 under the title, Along the Bowstring, but tourist traffic did not justify continuing the effort. Nevertheless, the road survived until the 1990s when it merged with the Wisconsin Central and was then absorbed by the Soo Line Railroad.',

      'By 1876 Rand, McNally and Company had decided to produce a business atlas especially addressed to everyone concerned with shipping goods and materials. Apparently it had in mind, at first, a kind of supplementary volume to those atlases readily available from Eastern publishers like Asher and Adams, but one with an emphasis on the western states. It soon discovered that national coverage was prerequisite to a successful product. Thus, although it issued its first business atlas “of the Great Mississippi Valley and Pacific Slope” in late 1876, it was superseded weeks later by a business atlas with national coverage. The 1877 volume, in 212 pages, emphasized that it featured a “new and original compilation and ready reference index...[to] the entire railroad system of the North America,” with a special page to explain all the abbreviations and to demonstrate how the index system worked by using the Ohio map as an example.',
      'Another Chicago publisher, the Cram Atlas Company, had issued a similar New Commercial Atlas of the United States, perhaps the first comprehensive atlas published west of the Alleghenies, in 1875. But it was only seventy-five pages in length and lacked the elaborate indexing system. Both Chicago publishers continued to issue successor atlases, but the Rand, McNally version, under continuous development and expansion, soon became the standard reference work. It appeared in annual editions starting in 1877 and continued until 2010.',
      'By 1887 it was revised four times each year to keep it current and a purchaser, called a subscriber by the company, would receive a copy of the quarterly changes free of charge for two years. Regular updates were needed because trackage was then expanding by hundreds of miles each month. An advertisement in Poorʼs Manual for 1887 pointed out that this meant a price of “Only 50 cents per month for a book that has cost over $25,000 to make.” By then the huge, heavy atlas featured ninety-two large scale double-page maps, mostly of American states and cities. By 1909, however, the railroad system had reached maturity and the quarterly updates were no longer needed. By then motor vehicles were starting to move public interest to road maps. Thus the map of Florida featured here should be viewed as one in a long series within each annual edition of this atlas, later called the Commercial Atlas, documenting the development of each state in large, attractive, and authoritative maps. The inset map, on a larger sale, of Lake, Orange, and Volusia (Seminole) counties, perhaps looks to the future. So do the township and range survey sections which give structure to the state by real estate references, perhaps with an eye to forthcoming land sales. After the tourist boom of the 1890s, largely inspired by the railroads, Florida and its maps would never be the same.',

In 1909, as this map shows, the route was only partially completed. Three more years would be needed to bring this “eighth wonder of the world” to completion. Then, in 1935, a hurricane would ruin much of the route, a tale that can be followed cartographically using the annual sequence of maps in the Commercial Atlas.',

But, since each company in a legal sense sent in a separate annual report to the state agency, each was listed separately on the map.

By 1910, the utility of systematic valuation became obvious and the ICC urged Congress to give it such authority and to finance the collection of data.',
      'The Railroad Valuation Act of 1913 put such a program into action and the Bureau of Valuation started collecting inventory data from the various companies to make a tentative valuation based on 1914 prices. This estimate could then be contested by the lines and the work had to be periodically updated. Maps such as this were central to the effort. They were usually supplied by each individual railroad and varied in format, scope and use. But they are a treasure house of information and currently housed in the National Archives in College Park, MD. This storehouse contains about 117,500 such maps gathered as early as 1910 with updated sheets in a few cases lasting until 1974. Sometimes duplicate copies and supporting materials can be found in the archives of individual lines.',
      'Note that this example, from the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railway, shows its depot and related buildings at Itasca, Illinois, in the dairy belt surrounding Chicago. Two sheds stored the milk cans which came and went each day. The platforms of wood by the station on the “to Chicago” side balanced a crushed stone and brick facility with a concrete curb on the outbound side. The siding at the upper left beyond a commodious outhouse for toilets, led to additional facilities such as a stock yard with a scale, a “pickle station,” several warehouses, a coal station and two lumberyards. Some of these facilities were probably not owned by the railroad, but their presence may have added value to their siding in an appraisal. Or, perhaps the company submitted one of its own working documents to the ICC. It’s also possible that the data, especially the details on street crossings with automatic gates, flashing lights and curbing may have been submitted to the Illinois Commerce Commission. In any event, the Itasca sheet provides a useful window into a railroad village in 1919, giving us an interesting comparison to the big city facility presented in Selection 9.',
      'The map of Mile 11, immediately to the east of this sheet, shows an old well, thirty-five feet deep and six feet in diameter, built of stone, that had been used to provide water for the boilers on the steam locomotives. The depth of the well suggests that it was pumped by hand because its depth was just beyond the height generally accessible to hydraulic ram pumps, also in use at the time, before gas and electric water pumps became common. A bunkhouse, toilet (outhouse) and several sheds stood nearby, pointing to Itasca as a place for railroad maintenance as well as a watering station, suggesting ways the railroad was integrated into the life of this small village. Indeed, the railroad had created the town when it laid its tracks in 1873.',

      'Almost from the beginning railroads in the United States used timetables to organize the movement of trains. They represented a marked improvement over travel by stagecoach, sail, or even steamboat. The first timetables appeared in local newspapers, using local times. They soon became promotional devices as well as information sheets and were printed as broadsides, on cardboard, for display at hotels and depots. Timetables from various lines were soon compiled into railroad guides so that passengers could arrange trips with suitable connections from one railroad to another. By the 1870s, with the advent of lower paper and printing costs, along with competition between competing lines, promotional timetables, often with maps, became common. These sheets, printed on both sides and folded into panels, assumed a standard format by the end of the nineteenth century.',
      'This example, from 1920, celebrates the company\'s completion of its transcontinental line in the early twentieth century. The Milwaukee Road, as it was popularly known, began laying rails in 1850 as the Milwaukee and Mississippi Rail Road. Then, through a series of mergers and acquisitions, it gained access to St. Paul and Chicago. In 1905 it was a major Midwestern system, but had to rely on other lines to reach the Pacific Coast. In a bold move it decided to extend its reach from South Dakota all the way to Puget Sound. In May 1909 a “last spike” ceremony signaled success, although a key tunnel through the Cascade Mountains was not put into use until 1915.',
      'By then another daring decision was being implemented, the electrification of the mountainous sections of the Puget Sound Extension. Note that this timetable map of 1920 points to the two electrified sections just completed which made the Milwaukee Road among the world\'s longest electrified railways. For passengers, the smooth, gearless ride uncluttered by smoke and soot gave them, according to the personalized itinerary sheets which accompanied each passenger, an “interesting journey,” without “weary moments” which would lead to “a liberal education in the progress and development of that section of the west traversed route.”',
      'The map was distorted, in typical railroad fashion, probably using an old route map because it shrinks its scale as it proceeds westbound from the former South Dakota railhead. Thus the electrified segments are actually de-emphasized by the map, a shortcoming that was soon corrected in subsequent timetable maps.',
      'A more serious fault, however, lay in the company\'s bold moves just before and after First World War, which proved to be a challenging time for US railroads in general. Although we can applaud the ecological advantage of the electric locomotives generating power when moving downhill, and returning this current to the grid, the economic benefits were never fully realized and in 1925 the Milwaukee Road was left bankrupt by its huge capital investments.',

      'In the early twentieth century La Salle Extension University in Chicago started a program to train traffic agents for the American business world. Since almost all freight moved by rail at the time, railroad rate structures were the central concern of the course. Moreover, railroad rates were regulated by both state and federal agencies, and often influenced by regional railroad associations. Thus the setting of rates and the selection of shipping venues had become very complex. In order to provide materials for this course of study the school apparently put together a loose-leaf atlas of traffic maps in 1913.',
      'The collection was originally edited by the instructor, William Arthur Shelton, associated from time to time with the Traffic Bureau of the Chicago and Northwestern Railway. Revised versions of the atlas appeared from time to time over the next decade or so, with the current instructors usually listed as editors. Wayne Edgar Butterbough, Charles E. Wyoming, and P. H Banks are associated with some issues of the atlas. Versions would be a better term than editions because even in a single year, like the 1925 copy used here, the atlas used for each course offering could vary markedly in the assigned editorship, maps selected, and their order of appearance.',
      'These attempts “to present comprehensive and accurate information....not to be found elsewhere in one place” (from a 1913 printing) furnished students with a cartographic gold mine. This 1925 version includes a map of interurban (electrified light rail) freight routes in the Middle West sponsored by the Central Electric Traffic Association. Most interurban railroad maps focus on passenger service and on state systems. This map reminds us of the freight traffic on these lines and casts the routes into a regional context (Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio and Michigan). The map notes that the association accounts for “5000 miles of electric railway service, but also documents the fragmentary nature of the system and how it best served local hubs like Indianapolis, Dayton, Cleveland, and Detroit.',
      'On a national scale, the Atlas is a convenient place to find a map of the Ripley Plan for the consolidation of railroads in the United States. Congress directed the Interstate Commerce Commission to prepare such a proposal in 1920. William Z. Ripley, a professor of economics at Harvard worked on the plan until 1929 when the Great Depression made the concept obsolete. The map showing the nineteen proposed systems as it stood in 1925 was developed by the La Salle Extension University using a C. S. Hammond & Co. base map. A chart on the following page indicated which railroads would be assigned to each group.',
      'The Atlas also included a collection of over forty railroad system maps such as that for the Southern Railway and its affiliates shown here. In addition, the book includes a series of railroad territorial maps like the one illustrating Southern freight routes in schematic fashion. Other forms of transportation are included in the general reference section of the Atlas: inland waterways, pipe lines, highways, airway routes, and the like.',

      'This manuscript map was probably reproduced as blueprint copies or by way of some other reproduction system to provide working papers for field workers and supervisors. Compiled by the Milwaukee Road and the Kansas City Southern Joint Agency, it gives the “lay of the land” from a railroader\'s perspective, at a huge industrial complex in Kansas City, Missouri. The juncture of the Kansas and Missouri Rivers provides a central focus for the map and enables an outside reader to relate the image to any map of the nation as a whole. The cartographer has provided a directional signal just to the left of the mouth of the Kansas River, indicating that the drawing is not set according to the cardinal directions but seems to follow the rough curve of the major stem of tracks from West End in Kansas to Leeds Junction in Missouri, where the Kansas City Southern mainline heads south to Port Arthur, Texas. Leeds Junction is where the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad tracks enter the Woodswether Industrial District which was erected on land once part of the riverbed.',
      'A host of factories, warehouses, and other facilities are labeled on the map according to the companies that use them. These buildings are not outlined; only their locations are noted. To fully reconstruct the past geography of the complex a modern researcher would need a fire insurance atlas of the complex. Instead, here the cartographer focuses on the trackage, providing lists of the car capacity of each track in the various yards and sidings. Each of these yards has a name, like Broadway or Elmdale, giving a human touch to an engineering document. For administrative purposes, however, the railroads have divided the complex into numbered zones. One would guess that this working document was used to help move, distribute, and store the cars bringing raw materials and taking away finished products from the manufacturing facilities crowding the complex.',
      'The names of the companies bring the map to life, from the Fisher Body, Chevrolet, and General Motors Parts Corp. tracks clustered north of the Leeds Yard to the Hershey Wholesale Grocery Company at the end of the Grand Avenue Ally Track on the inset which enlarges the scale for a particularly crowded area. The names near the roundhouse in zone 4A also furnish insight into the operation of freight railroads in 1945: Cinder Pit, Clam Shell, Coal Shute, Fuel Oil, Coal Storage, Store House, Runaround, Roundhouse Lead, and even, in a sign pointing to the future, Diesel Tracks. There is also an interesting “cartographic silence” on the map. It features parts of two states: Kansas and Missouri, but the boundary line does not appear on the map. Railroad maps often erase political boundaries.',

      'The 1950s spelled the end of the line for most of the passenger railroads in the United States. Long unprofitable from a variety of perspectives, rail service declined sharply after the Second World as Americans turned to the highways and airways for travel. In 1956 President Eisenhower signed the act creating the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways. Two years later the Boeing 707 jetliner inaugurated commercial jet service. Then, rather than subsidize rail travel in addition to constructing new highways and airports, the Interstate Commerce Act of 1958 streamlined the process by which companies could abandon passenger service. As the number of trains dropped each year it became apparent that only a federal effort could save even the shell of a national rail passenger system.',
      'The National Railroad Passenger Act of 1970 envisioned service to all of the nationʼs metropolitan areas with lines passing through all of the states, something similar to the Interstate Highways. On May 1, 1971, the newly named Amtrak service started operations but, as this, its second timetable map indicates, the system left out states like Maine, Arkansas, and South Dakota, and cities like Cleveland and Dallas had only “added” or “as soon as possible” service. Moreover, the map was misleading because many of the routes, especially in the West, operated only three days a week.',
      'Three railroads still offering passenger service in 1971 did not join Amtrak but, as this map indicates, their trains were limited to one or two routes. Moreover, Amtrak in 1971 did not own the trackage or right-of-way, only the right to run trains and ownership of the rolling stock, equipment, and stations. Federal subsidies subsequently kept the system operating, added some additional trains and routes, aided the purchase of new equipment and even some rights-of-way. After the terrorist strike of 9-11, the nation gained some appreciation for Amtrak and the development of high-speed rail corridors, but whether current plans and proposals will come to fruition remains a question.',
