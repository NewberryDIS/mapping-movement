# Rebuild of Mapping Movement

## part 0. Skeuomorphism.

That horribly-shaped word means "Buttons in iTunes in 2007". It doesn't really - what it really means is, mimicking traditional interface elements in a new interface in order to assint users to adopt something that otherwise might feel quite different. If, in 2007, buttons looked like they do now, a lot of people wouldn't identify then as buttons. So, Apple - and everyone else - designed their interface to have big, chunky, 3D-illusion interface elements.

We still use it in the traditional way - the icon for a phone app, for example - but, for the most part, digital interfaces are the norm. But the retro nature of the term still has value. While we don't (usually) _need_ to do it anymore, we can still attempt to replicate older user experiences into contemporary design - for fun - because some of the old interfaces were awesome.

As a librarian, it's about books - but there are other great ones - vinyl records, rolling the windows down in the car. We understand why these experiences have fallen out of common use, but we don't have to forget what we liked about them.

Curling up with a good book in the secluded back section of the library, having to get up and flip a record over after about 20 minutes - there's something wonderful about that.

Can we reproduce those experiences?

## part 1. Books.

The original version of the Mapping Movement project was driven by a strict adherence to the attempt to replicate a book-reading experience. I was not a part of that project; I was not in a position to help question their assumptions.

One of the core features of books, the original project team maintained, was that there are no images. As such, they didn't want images interspersed in the text. Books about maps often do have images, though, and even if they typically, this one did. Over the 15 essays in Mapping Movement, there are 150 maps. However, they felt strongly about this: books don't have pictures.

This is a fundamentally reductive view of a book-reading experience. There is so much more to how we experience a book than just what's printed on the page. You can put a book down, face-open, and pick it up, immediately where you left off - if you did to many things before coming back, there was no RAM caching issue to make you lose your place; there was less anxiety about the experience itself. With a book in your hands, you can stick a finger between the pages and flip through the book, and easily return to your starting point, feeling like you barely left it. In a book with vivid and vital images of maps, there are usually sections of the book where they're collected - identifiable by the unique paper which stood out against the color and texture of the rest of the book. Flipping to the plates was not only easy, but it was a vital part of the experience.

The online equivalent - clicking a link and then using the back button on the browser - is fundamentally different: even if the exact location on the page is preserved, the flow is broken; the mental space, the reader's mental position within the content, has changed.

While we can't (yet) adequately replicate that nimble orienteering, we can try to capture its _vibe_. And what better way to approach the project's core concept - of maps and movement, of maps which can show the movements of people - than to imbue the site with a sense of place, and of motion.

We used a smooth-scrolling navigation effect to suffuse place and motion into the interaction. While all sites have a sense of _space_, a sense of _place_, a sense of the being-within

with a sense of space and motion. Throughout the site, page pages are replaced by - or obscured with - a smooth scroll back to the top of the page, to replicate the experience of turning a physical page, and that movement of the eyes and the attention to the new page.

When a user clicks a link to go to a new essay, or to one of the map-specific pages,

One of the things I did to attempt to replicate the book experience was smooth scrolling to the top of a page. When you click on a link, rather than the page disappearing and a new page appearing, I made that disappearance and reappearance occur while the page was scrolling to the top. When you read a book, when you finish a page, your eyes follow that motion - so I meant to give users the sense of physical transition that accompanies page-turning. Additionally, one of the the things we've lost with digital interfaces is the patience - and while I wouldn't dream of wasting users' time by adding delays and timers and such, that scroll - it's a pause, a rest. It doesn't occur in the middle of the text anywhere, so the interruption only occurs when the user is shifting headspace anyway - and I hope that the brief, page-turning hiatus brought at least a moment of rest in otherwise hectic lives.

I did break up the text with maps. I broke that rule. I did it for a few reasons.

A. Skeuomorphism. People expect that on the web today, and subverting expectations should only ever be done when you've got something better to offer. Subverting the readers' expectations to provide them with a wall of text - a known bad interface design - was not something I was willing to do - I wouldn't subvert your expectations in order to give you something worse.

B. Audience. The Mapping Movement revitalization will not get the same fanfare as its original release; it won't be swarmed by academics pursuing cutting edge research. It's readers will be more casual: less _interested_ and more _curious_ - and that's a huge distinction. Readers could not be expected to travel through the content of their own volition - we had to invite them, tease them in further like a will o' the wisp. Maps have that power - not all maps, and not all presentations of maps - but if you do it right, you can pull people into a map.

## 2. Maps.

I don't know if there are people that don't like maps. I haven't met any, and if I have, I've surely eliminated it from my memory. Everyone loves maps. There's something so evocative about a map - so many things, really - I can't pretend to get anywhere near exhaustive here. But a few things stand out to me.

First, maps make me curious. In a map, I see spaces - foreign and familiar - in a new way. I see a stream that I've walked by - it seemed straight, but it isn't, it winds quite a lot. I see the buildings in my neighborhood and I can see their interplay, not just their view from the ground.

However, maps can appear noisy - an enormous amount of information transfered in a pretty samey way. Maps present themselves and their content as a pile of details - and if you can get a user to grab onto a single detail, the power of the map will take over from there - especially in the case of the Mapping Movement maps, which are as beautiful as they are fascinating.

As you scroll through a webpage, you scroll past images. This is common. Sometimes, the images scroll at a different speed - we call it parallax and while it's the newest design trend of 2013, it's been in use since side-scrolling video games of the 80s and 90s. At this point, it's not _uncommon_, but it's not super common. It's a known interface - but it still catches the eye.

In that moment, in which the map catches the user's eye,
